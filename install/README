Scripts and other files for installing Posda directly without using containers


The current plan:

Currently targetting only RHEL 7/8

An install script which
* installs system deps (via yum)
* installs perl deps (via cpan)
* installs python deps (via pip)
* installs pre-compiled local deps
* installs systemd files for launching services

In order to launch services, will probably need a special bash script
that can load all of the .env files.


For the database, currently it will need to be setup manually (though
it can be done using all.sql)


# Notes on things left to do
[*] Get Redis running (needs to be started)
[x] Get the FFP running
[ ] Run the setup.pl script to create the dir structure
[ ] The API is not getting all of it's required env vars! like paths
[ ] Worker Nodes
