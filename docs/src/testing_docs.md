# This is the test guide for Posda.

## Things to consider
* Make sure your preferred browser will allow pop-ups from the posda application.
* Make sure you have a user account in Posda
* Ensure your version of Posda to be tested is installed and running
* Ensure you have the Posda Importer GUI installed on the machine you intend to test

## If running locally from scratch
* locate the oneposda directory
* open a terminal
* type `./init` this will update your docker image
* type `./manage up` this will bring up your database and applications

## Download the DicomTestSet test data
* Found here: https://pathology.cancerimagingarchive.net/download/other/DicomTestSet.tgz

## Import the Data for Creation
