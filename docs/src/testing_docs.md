# This is the test guide for Posda.

## Things to consider
* Make sure your preferred browser will allow pop-ups from the posda application.
* Make sure you have a user account in Posda
* Ensure your version of Posda to be tested is installed and running
* Ensure you have the Posda Importer GUI installed on the machine you intend to test

## If running locally from scratch
* locate the oneposda directory
* open a terminal
* type `./init` this will update your docker image
* type `./manage up` this will bring up your database and applications

## Download the DicomTestSet test data
* Found here: https://pathology.cancerimagingarchive.net/download/other/DicomTestSet.tgz

## Import the Data for Creation

### Option 1: Using the Posda GUI importer
* Locate your copy of the DicomTestSet
* Open the Posda Importer GUI
  * ![alt text](testing_docs_images/Importer1.png "Posda Importer GUI Start Screen")
* Click "Create New Import"
  * ![alt text](testing_docs_images/Importer2.png "Posda Importer New Import Screen")
* Beginning on the left side of the window, Choose a name for the import
* Click Select Directory
  * ![alt text](testing_docs_images/Importer3.png "Posda Importer Directory Selection")
* Select the DicomTestSet test data directory,
  * Data about the folder should appear in the window (Here is an example with non-DicomTestSet data, DicomTestSet has 628 files)
  * ![alt text](testing_docs_images/Importer4.png "Posda Importer Directory Info")
* Choose your Environment (Local for testing, Production for actual work, your options are handled in the config files)
* Click "Create Import Event and Begin"
* Wait for files to complete importing, since this is test data it should have 0 errors. Real datasets will sometimes have issues to investigate using the Logs.
* Once the DicomTestSet data is fully imported you may close the application

### Option 2: Using DICOM Send
* Open the DicomTestSet directory in your preferred DICOM editor
* Setup the location for PosdaLocal in your preferences
* Select a subset of files to Send
* Click Send
