However, we recommend Linux be used\nfor the best compatibility. MacOS is the second-best choice, and we discourage\nthe use of Windows.\n\n\nAny Linux distribution should work, as long as you can install Docker, though\nwe have tested Posda on the following:\n\n\n\n\nUbuntu 16.04, 18.04\n\n\nRHEL 7\n\n\nAlpine\n\n\n\n\nType of Installation\n\n\nPosda supports a number of different types of installation. The main options\nare if separate storage will be used, and/or a separate database server. The\nreasons why you would make these choices are beyond the scope of this\ndocumentation, but you should make those choices before beginning installation.\n\n\nWe have included three example configurations in this guide:\n\n\n\n\nSmall - Single machine, for a small site, or development, or demonstration\n\n\nMedium - When separate storage is needed\n\n\nLarge - When separate storage and database servers are needed\n\n\n\n\nInstall Sizes / Types\n\n\nHere are three common types of installations, along with a list of which\nsections you would need to follow for each.\n\n\nSmall / Development Installation\n\n\nThis is the appropriate set of sections you would follow to install Posda\non a single machine, such as for development or demonstration purposes,\nor just an environment where this is all that is required.\n\n\n\n\nInstall Docker\n\n\nClone the Repo\n\n\nConfigure Common Settings\n\n\nStart Posda\n\n\n\n\nMedium / Separate Storage\n\n\n\n\nInstall Docker\n\n\nClone the Repo\n\n\nConnect storage to Host\n\n\nConfigure storage\n in docker-compose.yaml\n\n\nConfigure Common Settings\n\n\nStart Posda\n\n\n\n\nLarge / Separate Storage and Separate Database\n\n\n\n\nProvision database server, install PostgreSQL\n\n\nInstall Docker\n\n\nClone the Repo\n\n\nConnect storage to Host\n\n\nConfigure storage\n in docker-compose.yaml\n\n\nConfigure database\n\n\nConfigure Common Settings\n\n\nStart Posda\n\n\n\n\nInstall Docker\n\n\nInstalling Docker is beyond the scope of this documentation. You can find\nfurther information at the \nDocker Homepage\n.\n\n\nMake sure you also install \ndocker-compose\n. Instructions are available at\n\nInstall Docker Compose\n.\n\n\nClone Oneposda\n\n\nFirst you will need to install \ngit\n on your system. Once you have git, \nsimply clone Posda by typing:\n\n\ngit clone https://code.imphub.org/scm/pt/oneposda.git\n\n\n\n\nYou can place this directory anywhere you like.\n\n\nConfigure Storage\n\n\nThe bulk of the storage will be from the \"Posda Cache\", where all imported\nand edited DICOM files are stored. There is also the Postgres database data,\nif you are using the built-in database.\n\n\nBy default both storage locations are managed by Docker, but you may want\nto configure the location yourself, such as on network attached storage.\n\n\nThe main way you do this is by changing the \nvolume\n sections within the\nvarious services in the \ndocker-compose.yaml\n file.\n\n\nFor example, if you wanted to place all of the cache (DICOM) files within\nthe host directory \n/mnt/storage/posda\n, you would find all lines within\n\ndocker-compose.yaml\n that look like:\n\n\n- posda_cache_alpine:/home/posda/cache\n\n\n\n\nand change them to:\n\n\n- /mnt/storage/posda:/home/posda/cache\n\n\n\n\nMake sure you change all occurrences!\n\n\nNOTE: You should ensure that the owner:group ID of the chosen location\nis \n2123:2123\n. \n\n\nIf you additionally wanted to change where the built-in Postgres database\nstores its data, first choose a location (such as \n/mnt/storage/database\n),\nthen change the line that looks like:\n\n\n- pgdata_alpine:/var/lib/postgresql/data\n\n\n\n\nto instead be:\n\n\n- /mnt/storage/database:/var/lib/postgresql/data\n\n\n\n\nConfigure Database\n\n\nIf you have chosen to use a separate database host (instead of using the\ncontainer), you will need to complete this section.\n\n\nFirst, you must remove the \ndb\n service from the \ndocker-compose.yaml\n file.\nRemove these lines:\n\n\ndb:\n    image: postgres:10.1-alpine\n    restart: always\n    environment:\n        POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example\n    volumes:\n        - pgdata_alpine:/var/lib/postgresql/data\n    ports:\n        - 5433:5432\n\n\n\n\nThen, find every occurrence of \ndepends_on: db\n and remove it. For example,\nremove only the \n- db\n line from the following:\n\n\ndepends_on:\n    - db\n    - redis\n\n\n\n\nRemove this everywhere it occurs, otherwise the various containers will fail\nto start.\n\n\nFinally, you must edit the \ndatabase.env\n file, and set the appropriate values\nfor the database server you have configured. You must use a role which has\nthe ability to create databases. After initial configuration you can remove\nthat right, if you want.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nPGHOST=my-database-host.uams.edu\nPGUSER=posda\nPGPASSWORD=s3cret!\n\n\n\n\nConfigure Common Settings\n\n\nEdit the file \ncommon.env\n and set the values. In particular, you should\ncarefully choose \nPOSDA_EXTERNAL_HOSTNAME\n. \n\n\nStart Posda\n\n\nThe first time you start Posda, you will want to start the \ndb\n and \nposda\n\ncontainers first, and wait about 30 seconds after each command for\ninitial setup to complete.\n\n\nThe \nmanage\n script is a simple wrapper around \ndocker-compose\n, but it\nconfigures some things before each run, so it is recommend you use it\nrather than using \ndocker-compose\n directly.\n\n\nWARNING: If you have chosen to have a separate database host, you must skip\nthe first command.\n\n\nFrom the \noneposda\n directory, execute:\n\n\n./manage up -d db\n# Wait 30 seconds for the database to start\n./manage up -d posda\n# Wait 30 seconds for initial setup to complete\n./manage up -d",
