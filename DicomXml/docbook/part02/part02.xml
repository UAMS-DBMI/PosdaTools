    <title>Scope and Field of Application</title>
    <para>Conformance Statements are critical to interoperability because they provide important information for implementers and system integrators in order to determine whether or not applications do interoperate. In addition, when issues occur, they provide a source of information in order to potentially resolve any problems. Lastly, it is important to provide potential implementers with a consistent template for generating these documents.</para>

    <title>Purpose of a Conformance Statement</title>
    <para>An implementation need not employ all the optional components of the DICOM Standard. After meeting the minimum general requirements, a conformant DICOM implementation may utilize whatever SOP Classes, communications protocols, Media Storage Application Profiles, optional (Type 3) Attributes, codes and controlled terminology, etc., needed to accomplish its designed task.</para>
    <note>
      <para>In fact, it is expected that an implementation might only support the SOP Classes related to its Real World Activities. For example, a simple film digitizer may not support the SOP Classes for other imaging modalities since such support may not be required. On the other hand, a complex storage server might be required to support SOP Classes from multiple modalities in order to adequately function as a storage server. The choice of which components of the DICOM Standard are utilized by an implementation depends heavily on the intended application and is beyond the scope of this Standard.</para>
    </note>
    <para>In addition, the DICOM Standard allows an implementation to extend or specialize the DICOM defined SOP Classes, as well as define Private SOP classes.</para>
    <para>A Conformance Statement allows a user to determine which optional components of the DICOM Standard are supported by a particular implementation, and what additional extensions or specializations an implementation adds. By comparing the Conformance Statements from two different implementations, a knowledgeable user should be able to determine whether and to what extent communications might be supported between the two implementations.</para>
    <para>Different structures are used for the content of Conformance Statements depending on whether the implementation supports a DICOM network interface, a DICOM Media Storage interface, or a combination thereof. In the latter case, a single Conformance Statement shall be provided that consists of the appropriate sections.</para>
    <para>The first part of the conformance statement contains a DICOM Conformance Statement Overview, which is typically a one-page description in the beginning of the document providing a high level description and also listing the Networking and Media Service Classes, including their roles (SCU/SCP, FSC, FSR, etc.).</para>

      <para>The numbering scheme for numbering paragraphs in this document is to be used as a guideline in preparing the outline of the Conformance Statement. Although strongly encouraged, the Conformance Statement is not required to have exactly the same paragraph numbers because a particular Conformance Statement might have special considerations, which will cause the outline to differ in certain details from the outline of this document. In addition, a vendor might have internal company guidelines prescribing a specific format. Note however, that the overall structure, tables, definition of variables and information such as headers, should be strictly followed.</para>

        <title>Basics of DICOM Communication</title>
        <para>A layman's introduction to DICOM may be included here. The following example may be used as a template:</para>
        <para>This section describes terminology used in this Conformance Statement for the non-specialist. The key terms used in the Conformance Statement are highlighted in
  <emphasis role="italic">italics</emphasis>below. This section is not a substitute for training about DICOM, and it makes many simplifications about the meanings of DICOM terms.</para>
        <para>Two
  <emphasis role="italic">Application Entities</emphasis> (devices) that want to communicate with each other over a network using DICOM protocol must first agree on several things during an initial network "handshake". One of the two devices must initiate an
  <emphasis role="italic">Association</emphasis> (a connection to the other device), and ask if specific services, information, and encoding can be supported by the other device (<emphasis role="italic">Negotiation</emphasis>).</para>
        <para>DICOM specifies a number of network services and types of information objects, each of which is called an
  <emphasis role="italic">Abstract Syntax</emphasis> for the Negotiation. DICOM also specifies a variety of methods for encoding data, denoted
  <emphasis role="italic">Transfer Syntaxes</emphasis>. The Negotiation allows the initiating Application Entity to propose combinations of Abstract Syntax and Transfer Syntax to be used on the Association; these combinations are called
  <emphasis role="italic">Presentation Contexts</emphasis>. The receiving Application Entity accepts the Presentation Contexts it supports.</para>
        <para>For each Presentation Context, the Association Negotiation also allows the devices to agree on
  <emphasis role="italic">Roles</emphasis> - which one is the
  <emphasis role="italic">Service Class User</emphasis> (SCU - client) and which is the
  <emphasis role="italic">Service Class Provider</emphasis> (SCP - server). Normally the device initiating the connection is the SCU, i.e., the client system calls the server, but not always.</para>
        <para>The Association Negotiation finally enables exchange of maximum network packet (<emphasis role="italic">PDU</emphasis>) size, security information, and network service options (called
  <emphasis role="italic">Extended Negotiation</emphasis> information).</para>
        <para>The Application Entities, having negotiated the Association parameters, may now commence exchanging data. Common data exchanges include queries for worklists and lists of stored images, transfer of image objects and analyses (structured reports), and sending images to film printers. Each exchangeable unit of data is formatted by the sender in accordance with the appropriate
  <emphasis role="italic">Information Object Definition</emphasis>, and sent using the negotiated Transfer Syntax. There is a Default Transfer Syntax that all systems must accept, but it may not be the most efficient for some use cases. Each transfer is explicitly acknowledged by the receiver with a
  <emphasis role="italic">Response Status</emphasis> indicating success, failure, or that query or retrieve operations are still in process.</para>
        <para>Two Application Entities may also communicate with each other by exchanging media (such as a CD-R). Since there is no Association Negotiation possible, they both use a
  <emphasis role="italic">Media Application Profile</emphasis> that specifies "pre-negotiated" exchange media format, Abstract Syntax, and Transfer Syntax.</para>

        <title>Implementation Model</title>
        <para>The Implementation model consists of three sections: the Application Data Flow Diagram, specifying the relationship between the Application Entities and the "external world" or Real-World activities, a functional description of each Application Entity, and the sequencing constraints among them.</para>
        <section label="A.4.1.1" xml:id="sect_A.4.1.1">
          <title>Application Data Flow</title>
          <para>As part of the Implementation model, an Application Data Flow Diagram shall be included. This diagram represents all of the Application Entities present in an implementation, and graphically depicts the relationship of the AEs use of DICOM to Real-World Activities as well as any applicable User interaction. <xref linkend="figure_A.4.1-1" xrefstyle="select: label"/> is a template for such a Data Flow Diagram.</para>
          <para>In this illustration, according to figure A.4.1-1, an occurrence of local Real-World Activity A will cause local Application Entity &lt;1&gt; to initiate an association for the purpose of causing Real-World Activity X to occur remotely. It also shows that Real-World Activities B and Y are interactively related via Application Entity &lt;2&gt;, with B being local and Y Remote, and that local Application Entity 3 expects to receive an association request when remote Real-World Activity Z occurs so that it can perform Real-World Activity C and/or D. When the performance of Real-World activities relies on interactions within the implementation, one may depict the circles as overlapping as shown in <xref linkend="figure_A.4.1-1" xrefstyle="select: label"/>. Any such overlap shall be discussed in this section of a Conformance Statement.</para>
          <para>Typically, there is a one to one relationship between an AE and an AE Title. Devices may be capable of configuring the relationship between AE and AE Title (e.g., by merging Application Entities to use a single AE Title). This is specified in the configuration section.</para>

    <para>Disclaimer:</para>
    <para>This document is an example DICOM Conformance Statement for a fictional image acquisition modality called EXAMPLE-INTEGRATED-MODALITY produced by a fictional vendor called EXAMPLE-IMAGING-PRODUCTS.</para>
    <para>As stated in the annex title, this document is truly informative, and not normative. A conformance statement of an actual product might implement additional services and options as appropriate for its specific purpose. In addition, an actual product might implement the services described in a different manner and, for example, with different characteristics and/or sequencing of activities. In other words, this conformance statement example does not intend to standardize a particular manner that a product might implement DICOM functionality.</para>

              <para>The Storage Application Entity sends images and Presentation States to a remote AE. It is associated with the local real-world activity "Send Images &amp; GSPS". "Send Images &amp; GSPS" is performed upon user request for each study completed or for specific images selected. When activated by user's settings (auto-send), each marked set of images and associated Presentation States can be immediately stored to a preferred destination whenever a Patient/Study is closed by the user. If the remote AE is configured as an archive device the Storage AE will request Storage Commitment and if a commitment is successfully obtained will record this information in the local database.</para>

              <para>The Workflow Application Entity receives Worklist information from and sends MPPS information to a remote AE. It is associated with the local real-world activities "Update Worklist" and "Acquire Images". When the "Update Worklist" local real-world activity is performed the Workflow Application Entity queries a remote AE for worklist items and provides the set of worklist items matching the query request. "Update Worklist" is performed as a result of an operator request or can be performed automatically at specific time intervals. When the "Acquire Images" local real-world activity is performed the Workflow Application Entity creates and updates Modality Performed Procedure Step instances managed by a remote AE. Acquisition of images will result in automated creation of an MPPS Instance. Completion of the MPPS is performed as the result of an operator action.</para>

                <para>A user can select images and presentation states and request them to be sent to multiple destinations (up to 3). Each request is forwarded to the job queue and processed individually. When the "Auto-send" option is active, each marked instance or marked set of instances stored in database will be forwarded to the network job queue for a pre-configured auto-send target destination. Which instances will be automatically marked and the destination where the instances are automatically sent to can be configured. The "Auto-send" is triggered by the Close Patient user application.</para>
                <para>The Storage AE is invoked by the job control interface that is responsible for processing network archival tasks. The job consists of data describing the instances marked for storage and the destination. An internal daemon process triggered by a job for a specific network destination initiates a C-STORE request to store images. If the process successfully establishes an Association to a remote Application Entity, it will transfer each marked instance one after another via the open Association. Status of the transfer is reported through the job control interface. Only one job will be active at a time. If the C-STORE Response from the remote Application contains a status other than Success or Warning, the Association is aborted and the related Job is switched to a failed state. It can be restarted any time by user interaction or, if configured, by automated retry.</para>
                <para>The Storage AE attempts to initiate a new Association in order to issue a C-STORE request. If the job contains multiple images then multiple C-STORE requests will be issued over the same Association.</para>
                <para>If the Remote AE is configured as an archive device the Storage AE will, after all images and presentation states have been sent, transmit a single Storage Commitment request (N-ACTION) over the same Association. Upon receiving the N-ACTION response the Storage AE will delay releasing the Association for a configurable amount of time. If no N-EVENT-REPORT is received within this time period the Association will be immediately released (i.e., notification of Storage Commitment success or failure will be received over a separate association). However, the Storage AE is capable of receiving an N-EVENT-REPORT request at any time during an association provided a Presentation Context for the Storage Commitment Push Model has been successfully negotiated (i.e., the N-ACTION is sent at the end of one association and the N-EVENT-REPORT is received during an association initiated for a subsequent send job or during an association initiated by the Remote AE for the specific purpose of
  sending the N-EVENT-REPORT).</para>

If multiple images from the same study are being displayed the request to save the visual appearance will create one or more Presentation States referencing all displayed images. If images from multiple studies are being displayed at least a separate Presentation State will be created for each study.</para>

To protect the system from overflow, the EXAMPLE-INTEGRATED-MODALITY will limit the number of processed worklist responses to a configurable maximum.

    <para>This document is an example DICOM Conformance Statement for a product that supports DICOM SOP Classes frequently associated with a Radiology Information System or RIS. The product whose conformance is being documented, DICOMRis, and the manufacturer, Hospital Systems, are fictional.</para>
    <para>As stated in the annex title, this document is truly informative, and not normative. A conformance statement of an actual product might implement additional services and options as appropriate for its specific purpose. In addition, an actual product might implement the services described in a different manner and, for example, with different characteristics and/or sequencing of activities. In other words, this conformance statement example does not intend to standardize a particular manner that a product might implement DICOM functionality.</para>

      <title>Conformance Statement Overview</title>
      <para>Hospital Systems' DICOMRis is a suite of applications that implement a full-featured Radiology Information System (RIS). DICOMRis includes features typically associated with a RIS, including interfaces to various Hospital Information Systems, Patient Tracking, Results Reporting, Film Tracking, Management Reporting, PACS Integration, etc. The DICOMRis GUI-based client application, RisView, runs on a Windows 95/98/NT platform; the server platform is Digital Unix.</para>
      <para>As part of PACS Integration DICOMRis supports several DICOM Service Classes, using DICOMTool's DICOM Toolkit, to provide the following capabilities:</para>
      <para>Allowing Modalities to query for worklists of procedures to be performed and for patient and procedure demographics. DICOMRis processes these queries by directly accessing the DICOMRis database, which is automatically updated with appropriate data through the normal operations of the RIS.</para>
      <para>Updating the DICOMRis database in response to Procedure Step transactions initiated by Modalities as they perform examinations. Relevant data contained in these transactions may be viewed using RisView.</para>

            <para>DICOMSRV is a background process running on a Unix server. A single instance of DICOMSRV is started at System boot but multiple instances may be running at any one time as a result of forking of additional processes. The application may be started/restarted interactively via a utility. In addition, there is a monitoring process that may be configured to restart the application automatically should it crash. Events are logged to application-specific log files with a time stamp. Multiple logging levels are supported. At the lowest logging level the following are logged:</para>
            <itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>The AE Title of the remote AE when the Association is created</para>
              </listitem>
              <listitem>
                <para>The status of each DICOM Service Request</para>
              </listitem>
              <listitem>
                <para>Any updates to the DICOMRis Database</para>
              </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
            <para>Higher levels of logging can be configured to cause dumping of the contents of DICOM Service and Association messages..</para>
            <para>DICOMSRV will listen for connection requests at the Presentation Address configured for its AE Title. This application is an implementation of a concurrent server; it forks a new process for each connection request it receives. Each forked process exists for the life of a single association and then exits. DICOMSRV will accept Presentation Contexts for the Modality Worklist, Modality Performed Procedure Step and Verification SOP Classes. Validation of DICOM Service Request messages is configurable using command-line parameters and may return Failure status in the event of an invalid Service Request according to the specifications in the standard. Upon receipt of a Verification Request DICOMSRV will respond with a successful Verification response. When a MWL query is received DICOMSRV will query the DICOMRis database for a list of Scheduled Procedure Steps matching the query and will return a pending C-Find response for each match. Before DICOMRis can include patient and order
  information in response to a Modality Worklist query, patients must be registered and there must be orders for those patients in the DICOMRis database.. Registration and order information is typically interfaced to DICOMRis from a HIS but can also be entered directly into DICOMRis using DICOMRis's registration and order entry applications. Reception of an MPPS N-Create or N-Set Request may result in updates to various tables in the DICOMRis database and may result in changes to the procedure state of the Requested Procedure(s) referenced within the message. If an MPPS message containing non-matching demographic data is received, this will be logged, an exception document generated and an entry added to an exception table in the database.</para>

                <para>When Modality Worklist SCUs query DICOMSRV the queries run against the Scheduled Procedure Step Worklist (referred to hereafter as the 'SPS Worklist' or 'Worklist') in the DICOMRis database. There is a configurable mapping between the Universal Service ID contained in the HL7 Order messages (see <xref linkend="table_C.8.1-4" xrefstyle="select: label"/>) and one or more Requested Procedures within the DICOMRis database. A Requested Procedure may, in turn, map to 1 or more Scheduled Procedure Steps though the relation is usually 1-to-1. This mapping is also site-configurable. The relation between Accession Number (0008,0050) and Requested Procedure ID (0040,1001) is 1-to-1 within DICOMRis and these attributes have the same value in all MWL responses. Scheduled Procedure Step entries are added and removed from the Worklist as follows:</para>

                    <para>As mentioned previously, DICOMRis supports common RIS function to set the state of the procedure as it progresses from being ordered to being resulted and signed. Setting the procedure state may be initiated interactively via the Procedure Update application or as a result of various events. An entry in the SPS Worklist is removed when the Requested Procedure that is the parent of the SPS is set to a configured status. This configuration is system-wide applying equally to all procedures.</para>

                <para>As mentioned above, DICOMSRV is started at system boot time and is thus ready to process MPPS messages at any time thereafter. The sequencing diagram below specifies a common flow of messages related to this activity. Prior to this sequence of messages it is necessary that orders have been received from the HIS interface or created via DICOMRis Ordering and Scheduling application. Attributes from the orders and created procedures, usually queried using MWL, will be included in the MPPS messages the Modality sends to DICOMSRV. Key attributes in the MPPS N-CREATE and N-SET, specified below, are extracted and matched against values in the DICOMRis database. A match allows full update of all applicable DICOMRis database tables.</para>

                    <para>DICOMSRV stores the MPPS and executes the matching algorithm described in the conformance section below. If a successful match is found, then updates to various tables per the N-CREATE are performed. See <xref linkend="table_C.4.2-10" xrefstyle="select: label"/> for additional detail. In the matching case, the procedure state of the procedure(s) referenced in the MPPS is updated if so configured</para>

                <para>DICOMSRV also supports the 5 IHE Unidentified Patient Use Cases. Cases 1, 2 and 4 are transparent to the MPPS SCU and follow the normal flow. In case 3, the patient upon whom a given procedure must be immediately performed has been registered on the HIS and has a valid Patient ID but has no order specifying the applicable procedure. DICOMSRV recognizes this case when an MPPS N-CREATE is received with a matching Patient ID, zero-length Accession Number (0008,0050) and Requested Procedure ID (0040,1001). If the MPPS SCU is configured for support of IHE Trauma cases, DICOMSRV will order a procedure corresponding to the code contained in the Procedure Code Sequence (0008,1032), if this code is recognized, or will order a default procedure based on configuration. If the default procedure is ordered then a user may modify the procedure using DICOMRis Ordering and Scheduling application.</para>
                <para>In case 5, there is no existing registration or order for a patient on whom a procedure must be immediately performed. Values are entered on the Modality identifying the patient and procedure. DICOMSRV recognizes this case when an MPPS N-CREATE is received containing a Patient ID within a configured range. This range will never contain Patient IDs created in the normal flow. If the MPPS SCU is configured for support of IHE Trauma cases, DICOMSRV will register the patient with the Patient ID provided and will order a procedure as described above.</para>

    <para>This document is an example DICOM Conformance Statement for a fictional image display device for DICOM images and spectroscopy objects obtained over the network, from interchange media, or from <olink targetdoc="PS3.10" targetptr="PS3.10" xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/> files loaded from the local file system.</para>
    <para>As stated in the annex title, this document is truly informative, and not normative. A conformance statement of an actual product might implement additional services and options as appropriate for its specific purpose. In addition, an actual product might implement the services described in a different manner and, for example, with different characteristics and/or sequencing of activities. In other words, this conformance statement example does not intend to standardize a particular manner that a product might implement DICOM functionality.</para>

      <para>The application supports querying a remote system for a list of DICOM objects that may then be retrieved to the local system. It also supports sending locally loaded images across the network to another system.</para>
      <para>All storage SOP Classes defined as of DICOM 2002 can be received, stored and transmitted by the application, but only images and spectroscopy objects may be loaded and viewed. All single and multi-frame with grayscale and RGB color (but not palette color, except for Enhanced MR images) images may be displayed.</para>
      <para>Only hierarchical query and retrieval is supported.</para>

                  <para>Only a single information model, Study Root, is supported.</para>
                  <para>All queries are initiated at the highest level of the information model (the STUDY level), and then for each response received, recursively repeated at the next lower levels (the SERIES and then IMAGE levels), in order to completely elucidate the "tree" of instances available on the remote AE (from which the user may subsequently request a retrieval at any level).</para>
                  <para>No CANCEL requests are ever issued.</para>
                  <para>Unexpected attributes returned in a C-FIND response (those not requested) are listed in the browser at the appropriate level if present in the dictionary. Requested return attributes not returned by the SCP are ignored. Non-matching responses returned by the SCP due to unsupported (hopefully optional) matching keys are not filtered locally by the FIND-SCU and thus will still be presented in the browser. No attempt is made to filter out duplicate responses.</para>
                  <para>Specific Character Set will always be included at every query level. If present in the response, Specific Character Set will be used to identify character sets other than the default character set for display of strings in the browser.</para>

An "S" indicates the identifier attribute uses Single Value Matching, an "R" indicates Range Matching, a n"*"indicates wild card matching, a 'U' indicates Universal Matching, and an 'L' indicates that UID lists are sent. "NONE" indicates that no matching is supported, but that values for this Element are requested to be returned (i.e., universal matching), and "UNIQUE" indicates that this is the Unique Key for that query level, in which case Universal Matching or Single Value Matching is used depending on the query level.</para>

                  <para>The retrieval is performed from the AE that was specified in the Retrieve AE attribute returned from the query performed by FIND-SCU. The instances are retrieved to the current application's local database by specifying the destination as the AE Title of the STORE-SCP AE of the local application. This implies that the remote C-MOVE SCP must be preconfigured to determine the presentation address corresponding to the STORE-SCP AE. The STORE-SCP AE will accept storage requests addressed to it from anywhere, so no pre-configuration of the local application to accept from the remote AE is necessary (except in so far as it was necessary to configure FIND-SCU).</para>

                  <title>Sub-Operation Dependent Behavior</title>
                  <para>Since the C-MOVE operation is dependent on completion of C-STORE sub-operations that are occurring on a separate association, the question of failure of operations on the other association(s) must be considered.</para>
                  <para>MOVE-SCU completely ignores whatever activities are taking place in relation to the STORAGE-SCP AE that is receiving the retrieved instances. Once the C-MOVE has been initiated it runs to completion (or failure) as described in the C-MOVE response command message(s). There is no attempt by MOVE-SCU to confirm that instances have actually been successfully received or locally stored.</para>
                  <para>Whether or not completely or partially successfully retrievals are made available in the local database to the user is purely dependent on the success or failure of the C-STORE sub-operations, not on any explicit action by MOVE-SCU.</para>
                  <para>Whether or not the remote AE attempts to retry any failed C-STORE sub-operations is beyond the control of MOVE-SCU.</para>
                  <para>If the association on which the C-MOVE was issued is aborted for any reason, whether or not the C-STORE sub-operations continue is dependent on the remote AE; the local STORAGE-SCP will continue to accept associations and storage operations regardless.</para>

    <para>As stated in the annex title, this document is truly informative, and not normative. A conformance statement of an actual product might implement additional services and options as appropriate for its specific purpose. In addition, an actual product might implement the services described in a different manner and, for example, with different characteristics and/or sequencing of activities. In other words, this conformance statement example does not intend to standardize a particular manner that a product might implement DICOM functionality.</para>

      <title>Conformance Statement Overview</title>
      <para>This fictional product EXAMPLE-PRINT-SERVER-MANAGEMENT implements the necessary DICOM services to facilitate the Print (SCP) Imaging Management in the healthcare departments, managing Print imaging over a network on Medical Laser Imaging Systems. It enables the capabilities to capture images at any networked DICOM modality and then print them anywhere they're needed in the medical facility.</para>
      <para>Furthermore, before sending the images to be printed the EXAMPLE-PRINT-SERVER-MANAGEMENT will apply image processing, using presentation parameters and LUT to improve the image presentation quality and consistency. Moreover, it will manage the printing presentation format and the Printer queue and Configuration.</para>

            <para>The Print Server System acquires the images with the demographics and presentation information from the connected Print Composer (SCU) that is Grouped with a Workstation or an Archive device. Studies are temporarily stored on disk. The images are then processed and formatted and finally queued as a print job on the Printer queue. If the Printer is operating normally, then the film sheets described in the print-job will be printed. Changes in the Printer operation status will be detected (e.g., film Magazine empty) and reported back to the Print SCU. If the Printer is not operating normally, then the print-job will be set to an error state and can be restarted by the user via the job control interface.</para>

It can thus be used to query whether the EXAMPLE-QUERY-RETRIEVE-SERVER will confirm ownership and responsibility for specific Composite SOP Instances.

The STORAGE-SCU AE must be correctly configured with the host and port number of any external DICOM AEs that are to be C-MOVE retrieval destinations.

              <para>The maximum number of simultaneous Associations is configurable, but is usually limited to a maximum of 10. This configuration largely depends on whether relatively quick response to multiple simultaneous C-MOVE Destination AEs is required or maximum throughput performance is required. If the latter is the case, then no simultaneous Associations are permitted, in order to reduce disk thrashing and thus maximize throughput. The STORAGE-SCU AE can initiate simultaneous Associations to a given external C-MOVE Destination AE up to the maximum number configured. There is no separate limit on the maximum number permitted to the same C-MOVE Destination AE.</para>
              <para>If the first attempt to open an Association fails then the STORAGE-SCU AE will reschedule the task to attempt it again after a configurable time delay. The number of times to reattempt Association establishment is configurable, with the default being zero.</para>

The QUERY-RETRIEVE-SCP AE will issue such a command whenever it receives a valid C-MOVE Request. An Association Request is sent to the specified C-MOVE Destination AE and upon successful negotiation of the required Presentation Context the image transfer is started.

The Association will be released when all the images have been sent. If an error occurs during transmission over an open Association then the image transfer is halted.

                  <para>The SOP Classes and Transfer Syntaxes that the STORAGE-SCU AE proposes, as listed above, represent the default behavior. The STORAGE-SCU AE can be configured to propose a subset of these contexts or additional Presentation Contexts. Also, the default Behavior is to propose just a single Transfer Syntax per Presentation Context. However, this can be altered so that every proposed Presentation Context has a unique SOP Class and one or more Transfer Syntaxes. That is, the default behavior is to determine the Transfer Syntaxes the SCP can accept as opposed to which it prefers.</para>

The entire set of tags received with the image will be saved in EXAMPLE-QUERY-RETRIEVE-SERVER; this includes all Private and SOP Extended Elements. When a SOP Instance is selected for export from EXAMPLE-QUERY-RETRIEVE-SERVER, its content will be exported as it was originally received except for a few possible exceptions. Some of the Patient demographic and Study information Elements whose values can have been altered due to changes administered on EXAMPLE-QUERY-RETRIEVE-SERVER or changes to the state of the image data due to compression can be altered when the SOP Instance is exported.</para>
                <para>The Patient demographic and Study information can be entered or altered by several means: manually, or from HL7 messaging,. The replacement behavior depends on which specific DICOM and HL7 services are supported. Also, this behavior is configurable. Values can be altered without changing the SOP Instance UID unless otherwise noted. Refer to the Annex for the specific details of which Elements can have their values altered at time of export.</para>
                <para>The EXAMPLE-QUERY-RETRIEVE-SERVER creates files called Service Logs that can be used to monitor their status and diagnose any problems that may arise. If any error occurs during DICOM communication then appropriate messages are always output to these Service Logs. In addition, error messages may be output as alerts to the User Interface in certain cases.</para>

              <para>The QUERY-RETRIEVE-SCP AE can support multiple simultaneous Associations. Each time the QUERY-RETRIEVE-SCP AE receives an Association, a child process will be spawned to process the Verification, Query, or Retrieval request. The maximum number of child processes, and thus the maximum number of simultaneous Associations that can be processed, is set by configuration. The default maximum is 10 in total. The maximum number of simultaneous Associations can be either an absolute number or a maximum number for each requesting external Application Entity. The latter flexibility can be useful if communication with one external AE is unreliable and one does not wish 'hung' connections with this AE to prevent Associations with other client AEs.</para>

The QUERY-RETRIEVE-SCP AE will notify the STORAGE-SCU to send the requested SOP Instances to the C-MOVE Destination. The STORAGE-SCU AE notifies the QUERY-RETRIEVE-SCP AE of the success or failure of each attempt to send a Composite SOP Instance to the peer C-MOVE Destination AE. The QUERY-RETRIEVE-SCP AE then sends a C-MOVE Response indicating this status after each attempt. Once the STORAGE-SCU AE has finished attempting to transfer all the requested SOP Instances, the QUERY-RETRIEVE-SCP AE sends a final C-MOVE Response indicating the overall status of the attempted retrieval.</para>

                <para>The QUERY-RETRIEVE-SCP AE supports hierarchical queries and not relational queries. There are no attributes always returned by default. Only those attributes requested in the query identifier are returned. Query responses always return values from the EXAMPLE-QUERY-RETRIEVE-SERVER database. Exported SOP Instances are always updated with the latest values in the database prior to export. Thus, a change in Patient demographic information will be contained in both the C-FIND Responses and any Composite SOP Instances exported to a C-MOVE Destination AE.</para>

                <para>The QUERY-RETRIEVE-SCP AE will convey to the STORAGE-SCU AE that an Association with a DICOM Application Entity named by the external C-MOVE SCU (through a MOVE Destination AE Title) should be established. It will also convey to the STORAGE-SCU AE to perform C-STORE operations on specific images requested by the external C-MOVE SCU. One or more of the Image Storage Presentation Contexts listed in <xref linkend="table_F.4.2-6" xrefstyle="select: label"/> will be negotiated.</para>
                <para>The QUERY-RETRIEVE-SCP AE can support lists of UIDs in the C-MOVE Request at the Study, Series, and Image Levels. The list of UIDs must be at the Level of the C-MOVE Request however. For example, if the C-MOVE Request is for Series Level retrieval but the identifier contains a list of Study UIDs then the C-MOVE Request will be rejected, and the A900 Failed Status Code will be returned in the C-MOVE Response.</para>
                <para>An initial C-MOVE Response is always sent after confirming that the C-MOVE Request itself can be processed. After this, the QUERY-RETRIEVE-SCP AE will return a response to the C-MOVE SCU after the STORAGE-SCU AE has attempted to send each image. This response reports the number of remaining SOP Instances to transfer, and the number transferred having a successful, failed, or warning status. If the Composite SOP Instances must be retrieved from long-term archive prior to export there may be quite a long delay between the first C-MOVE Response and the next one after the attempt to export the first image. The maximum length of time for this delay will depend on the particular type of archive used but typically varies between 3 and 10 minutes.</para>

              <para>The STORAGE-SCP AE can support multiple simultaneous Associations requested by peer AEs. Each time the STORAGE-SCP AE receives an Association, a child process will be spawned to process the Verification, Storage, or Storage Commitment Push Model Service requests. The maximum number of child processes, and thus the maximum number of simultaneous Associations that can be processed, is set by configuration. The default maximum number is 10 in total. This maximum number of simultaneous Associations can be either an absolute number or a maximum number for each requesting external Application Entity. The latter flexibility can be useful if communication with one external AE is unreliable and one does not wish 'hung' connections with this AE to prevent Associations with other client AEs.</para>

                <para>The STORAGE-SCP AE will initiate a new Association if a Storage Commitment Push Model Notification (N-EVENT-REPORT) cannot be sent back over the original Association used to send the corresponding request. A new Association will always be requested by the STORAGE-SCP AE in such cases even if the peer AE requests another Association after the original has been closed (i.e., A peer AE opens an Association and sends some Storage requests and a Storage Commitment Push Model request. Before the STORAGE-SCP AE can send the Storage Commitment Push Model N-EVEN-REPORT the Association is closed. The peer AE then opens another Association and begins to send Storage requests. In such a case the STORAGE-SCP AE will always initiate a new Association to send the N-EVENT-REPORT even though it could send the N-EVENT-REPORT over the new Association opened by the peer AE).</para>
                <para>An Association Request is sent to the peer AE that sent the Storage Commitment Push Model request and upon successful negotiation of the required Presentation Context the outstanding N-EVENT-REPORT is sent. If there are multiple outstanding N-EVENT-REPORTs to be sent to a single peer AE then the STORAGE-SCP AE will attempt to send them all over a single Association rather than requesting a new Association for each one. The Association will be released when all the N-EVENT-REPORTs for the peer AE have been sent. If any type of error occurs during transmission (either a communication failure or indicated by a Status Code returned by the peer AE) over an open Association then the transfer of N-EVENT-REPORTs is halted. A new Association will be opened to retry sending outstanding N-EVENT-REPORTs. The maximum number of times the STORAGE-SCP AE will attempt to resend an N-EVENT-REPORT is configurable, along with the amount of time to wait between attempts to resend.</para>
                <para>If the STORAGE-SCP AE sends a Notification request (N-EVENT-REPORT-RQ) over the original Association opened by the peer AE but receives a request to close the Association rather than a response to the Notification (N-EVENT-REPORT-RSP) then this is handled in the same way as if the request to close the Association had been received before trying to send the Notification request. Thus, the STORAGE-SCP AE will then open a new Association to resend the Notification request.</para>

                <para>If the STORAGE-SCP AE receives a request to close the Association from the peer AE before sending the Notification request (N-EVENT-REPORT-RQ) or when expecting to receive a Notification response (N-EVENT-REPORT-RSP) then it will open a new Association to send (or resend) the Notification. Refer to 0 for the details. The STORAGE-SCP AE has a configurable timeout value for the maximum amount of time that it will wait on an open Association for a new request from a peer AE. A peer AE can reset this timer by sending a Verification request (C-ECHO-RQ). This can act as a useful mechanism for a peer AE to maintain an active Association if the length of time between sending Storage or Storage Commitment requests can be long (such as when using a single Association to send images as they are acquired during an ultrasound exam).</para>

                <para>The default Behavior of the STORAGE-SCP AE supports the Implicit VR Little Endian and Explicit VR Little Endian Transfer Syntaxes for all Associations. In addition, explicit JPEG (baseline lossy) compression syntax is supported for the following SOP Classes: US Image, US Multi-frame Image, US Image (retired), US Multi-frame Image (retired), VL Image, VL Multi-frame and Secondary Capture Image Storage.</para>
                <para>The STORAGE-SCP AE can be configured to accept a subset of these Transfer Syntaxes, with the inclusion of Implicit VR Little Endian being mandatory.</para>
                <para>If multiple Transfer Syntaxes are proposed per Presentation Context then only the most preferable Transfer Syntax is accepted. The order of Transfer Syntax preference for the STORAGE-SCP AE is configurable. The default preference order if multiple Transfer Syntaxes are proposed in a single Presentation Context is: JPEG Baseline1, Little Endian Explicit, Little Endian Implicit (if all these are proposed for a single Presentation Context). This means that if the Implicit VR Little Endian and Explicit VR Little Endian Transfer Syntaxes are proposed in a single Presentation Context then the accepted Transfer Syntax will be Explicit VR Little Endian. This order of preference is configurable.</para>

                <para>The associated Activity with the Storage service is the storage of medical image data received over the network on a designated hard disk. The STORAGE-SCP AE will return a failure status if it is unable to store the images on to the hard disk.</para>
                <para>The STORAGE-SCP AE does not have any dependencies on the number of Associations used to send images to it. Images belonging to more than one Study or Series can be sent over a single or multiple Associations. Images belonging to a single Study or Series can also be sent over different Associations. There is no limit on either the number of SOP Instances or the maximum amount of total SOP Instance data that can be transferred over a single Association.</para>
                <para>The STORAGE-SCP AE is configured to retain the original DICOM data in DICOM Part 10 compliant file format. The STORAGE-SCP AE is Level 2 (Full) conformant as a Storage SCP. In addition, all Private and SOP Class Extended Elements are maintained in the DICOM format files. In addition to saving all Elements in files, a subset of the Elements are stored in the EXAMPLE-QUERY-RETRIEVE-SERVER database to support query and retrieval requests and also allow updating of Patient, Study, and Series information by user input, or demographic and Study related messages. Refer to the Annex for the list of Elements that are checked and/or processed upon receiving a Composite SOP Instance.</para>
                <para>The Behavior for handling duplicate SOP Instances is configurable. The default Behavior is to assign a new SOP Instance UID to a received SOP Instance if it conflicts with an existing SOP Instance UID. An alternative configuration is possible that causes the original object with the conflicting SOP Instance UID to be replaced by the new SOP Instance. This Behavior is most commonly enabled if a Storage SCU re-sends entire Studies or Series if a single failure occurs when sending a group of SOP Instances.</para>
                <para>For the purposes of image display the system supports the following photometric interpretations: MONOCHROME1, MONOCHROME2, RGB, PALETTE COLOR, YBR FULL 422, and YBR FULL.</para>
                <para>It is expected that optimal Window Center and Width values are specified in the DICOM Image Objects if they have greater than 8 bits of image data stored per sample. If optimal Window Center and Width values are not provided, then the EXAMPLE-QUERY-RETRIEVE-SERVER is capable of estimating values using histogram analysis.</para>
                <para>For multi-frame image SOP Instances sent using JPEG compression Transfer Syntax, sending a fully specified offset table increases performance, because the entire file does not have to be parsed to find the individual frame offsets. However, the inclusion of an offset table is not required for archiving or viewing of such SOP Instances.</para>
                <para>Display of information conveyed using the DICOM Curve Module is not supported. Graphic overlay data sent either embedded in the unused image pixel data bits or in the separate Overlay Data Element is supported for display. Region of Interest overlays are not yet supported.</para>
                <para>If an image SOP Instance specifies an aspect ratio that is not one-to-one then the image data will be automatically resized when displayed on the system monitor so that they are always displayed in a one-to-one aspect ratio.</para>
                <para>The average throughput performance has been determined to be between 2 and 6 Mega Bytes per second on a 100 Megabit Ethernet network. Actual performance will depend greatly on the performance of the C-STORE SCU, the number of simultaneous active Associations, and the underlying network performance.</para>

                <title>SOP Specific Conformance for Storage Commitment SOP Class</title>
                <para>The associated Activity with the Storage Commitment Push Model service is the communication by the STORAGE-SCP AE to peer AEs that it has committed to permanently store Composite SOP Instances that have been sent to it. It thus allows peer AEs to determine whether the EXAMPLE-QUERY-RETRIEVE-SERVER has taken responsibility for the archiving of specific SOP Instances so that they can be flushed from the peer AE system.</para>
                <para>The STORAGE-SCP AE takes the list of Composite SOP Instance UIDs specified in a Storage Commitment Push Model N-ACTION Request and checks if they are present in the EXAMPLE-QUERY-RETRIEVE-SERVER database. As long as the Composite SOP Instance UIDs are present in the database, the STORAGE-SCP AE will consider those Composite SOP Instance UIDs to be successfully archived. The STORAGE-SCP AE does not require the Composite SOP Instances to actually be successfully written to archive media in order to commit to responsibility for maintaining these SOP Instances.</para>
                <para>Once the STORAGE-SCP AE has checked for the existence of the specified Composite SOP Instances, it will then attempt to send the Notification request (N-EVENT-REPORT-RQ). The default behavior is to attempt to send this Notification over the same Association that was used by the peer AE to send the original N-ACTION Request. If the Association has already been released or Message transfer fails for some reason then the STORAGE-SCP AE will attempt to send the N-EVENT-REPORT-RQ over a new Association. The STORAGE-SCP AE will request a new Association with the peer AE that made the original N-ACTION Request. The STORAGE-SCP AE can be configured to always open a new Association in order to send the Notification request.</para>
                <para>The STORAGE-SCP AE will not cache Storage Commitment Push Model N-ACTION Requests that specify Composite SOP Instances that have not yet been transferred to the EXAMPLE-QUERY-RETRIEVE-SERVER. If a peer AE sends a Storage Commitment Push Model N-ACTION Request before the specified Composite SOP Instances are later sent over the same Association, the STORAGE-SCP AE will not commit to responsibility for such SOP Instances.</para>
                <para>The STORAGE-SCP AE does not support the optional Storage Media File-Set ID &amp; UID attributes in the N-ACTION.</para>
                <para>The EXAMPLE-QUERY-RETRIEVE-SERVER never automatically deletes Composite SOP Instances from the archive. The absolute persistence of SOP Instances and the maximum archiving capacity for such SOP Instances is dependent on the archiving media and capacity used by the EXAMPLE-QUERY-RETRIEVE-SERVER and is dependent on the actual specifications of the purchased system. It is necessary to check the actual system specifications to determine these characteristics.</para>
                <para>The STORAGE-SCP AE will support Storage Commitment Push Model requests for SOP Instances of any of the Storage SOP Classes that are also supported by the STORAGE-SCP AE:</para>

                  <para>The retrieval is performed from the AE that was specified in the Retrieve AE attribute returned from the query performed by FIND-SCU. The instances are retrieved to the current application's local database by specifying the destination as the AE Title of the STORE-SCP AE of the local application. This implies that the remote C-MOVE SCP must be preconfigured to determine the presentation address corresponding to the STORE-SCP AE. The STORE-SCP AE will accept storage requests addressed to it from anywhere, so no pre-configuration of the local application to accept from the remote AE is necessary (except in so far as it was necessary to configure FIND-SCU).</para>

                  <title>Sub-Operation Dependent Behavior</title>
                  <para>Since the C-MOVE operation is dependent on completion of C-STORE sub-operations that are occurring on a separate association, the question of failure of operations on the other association(s) must be considered.</para>
                  <para>MOVE-SCU completely ignores whatever activities are taking place in relation to the STORAGE-SCP AE that is receiving the retrieved instances. Once the C-MOVE has been initiated it runs to completion (or failure) as described in the C-MOVE response command message(s). There is no attempt by MOVE-SCU to confirm that instances have actually been successfully received or locally stored.</para>
                  <para>Whether or not completely or partially successfully retrievals are made available in the local database to the user is purely dependent on the success or failure of the C-STORE sub-operations, not on any explicit action by MOVE-SCU.</para>
                  <para>Whether or not the remote AE attempts to retry any failed C-STORE sub-operations is beyond the control of MOVE-SCU.</para>
                  <para>If the association on which the C-MOVE was issued is aborted for any reason, whether or not the C-STORE sub-operations continue is dependent on the remote AE; the local STORAGE-SCP will continue to accept associations and storage operations regardless.</para>

          <para>The WADO Service Application receives WADO requests from a remote AE. These requests may be either over the URI, WS or RS interfaces. It is associated with the local real-world activity "Retrieve Images". It converts these requests into internal lookup functions to find the matching SOP Instances. It then obtains these matching SOP Instances and composes a response back to the requesting remote AE.</para>

            <para>The reception of a WADO request will activate the AE. An internal request is sent to the search capabilities of the EXAMPLE-WADO-SERVICE. This request is based upon the request parameters or the URL resource end point from the WADO request. The response is a list of all SOP instances stored on the EXAMPLE-PACS-ARCHIVE that match the request parameters. If there are no matching instances, the AE will indicate this in the WADO response. For all matching instances, the AE will utilize the internal image transfer request to obtain a copy of each instance. If the request was for retrieval of instances, these instances will be returned. If the request was for retrieval of rendered instances, then the AE will render each instance and return the rendered results.</para>

    <para>As stated in the annex title, this document is truly informative, and not normative. A conformance statement of an actual product might implement additional services and options as appropriate for its specific purpose. In addition, an actual product might implement the services described in a different manner and, for example, with different characteristics and/or sequencing of activities. In other words, this conformance statement example does not intend to standardize a particular manner that a product might implement DICOM functionality.</para>
