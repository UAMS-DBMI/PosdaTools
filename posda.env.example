# This is the Posda Environment Configuration file.
# It is a bash environment file, and can be sourced to setup
# a Posda environment. TODO make this sound better

#########
# Paths #
#########

# The full path to the directory where the Posda source is installed.
export POSDA_ROOT=/home/posda/posdatools


# The full path to the file cache. This is the main storage area
# for Posda, and should be set to a path with a large amount of free space.
export POSDA_CACHE_ROOT=/home/posda/cache


#########
# Ports #
#########

# The base Posda port.
# Posda will use this port and 20 ports after it, for various things.
# The Extraction Manager listens on $POSDA_PORT+1
# Sub-applications listen on $POSDA_PORT+x, where x < 20
# So, with the default port of 64610, the following ports would be used:
#
#   64610         Main HTTP Interface
#   64611         Extraction Manager
#   64612-64630   Sub-applications
