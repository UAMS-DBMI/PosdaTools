#
# This is the Posda Environment Configuration file.
# It is a bash environment file, and can be sourced to setup
# a Posda environment. TODO make this sound better
#
#

#########
# Paths #
#########

# The full path to the directory where the Posda source is installed.
export POSDA_ROOT=/home/posda/posdatools


# The full path to the file cache. This is the main storage area
# for Posda, and should be set to a path with a large amount of free space.
export POSDA_CACHE_ROOT=/home/posda/cache


#########
# Ports #
#########

# The base Posda port.
# Posda will use this port and 20 ports after it, for various things.
# The Extraction Manager listens on $POSDA_PORT+1
# Sub-applications listen on $POSDA_PORT+x, where x < 20
# So, with the default port of 64610, the following ports would be used:
#
#   64610         Main HTTP Interface
#   64611         Extraction Manager
#   64612-64630   Sub-applications
export POSDA_PORT=64610

# If you wish to use username/password authentication with your
# Postgres server, you should set these and ensure they are the same
# for all of your databases. These environment variables will apply to
# all Postgres connections made by Posda, so it is important that they
# be correct and the same.
# export PGUSER=postgres
# export PGPASSWORD=mysecret


# The host that the databases are running on. By default this is
# localhost, but you can run the database server on a seperate host if
# you like.
# This version of Posda requires all databases be running on the same
# host, though future versions may allow per-database settings.
# Note:  Do not set this variable to localhost, as this will cause
#        problems with Postgres connecting. Only set this value if
#        your databases are on a host OTHER THAN localhost.
