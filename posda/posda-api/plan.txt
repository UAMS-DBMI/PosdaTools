Posda API Plan
==============

Exiting things we need to replicate or incorporate:
downloadable_file
downloadable_dir


Other endpoint ideas:

* emails
* subprocess records




---------
Decision:
Flat approach, with nesting when needed.
When it comes to creating, the full nesting might be necessary
At that time, it might make sense to add the full nested path as a GET alias
On second thought, it might make sense to implement both now...
If the user wants to list all studies for a given patient, it would make
the most sense to access that via:
/collections/HNSCC/Lahey/patients/PAT01/studies

Hmm but then what if we knew the study_id and wanted the series?
/studies/1.2.3.45534.43534223..../series

Would it be possible to support all of these? Possibly, if we're careful.
---------


Resources:
* collections
* patients
* studies
* series
* files
* structure-sets
* rois


NOTE: Some resources currently require a nested path to uniquely identify them.


Simple list of end points:

/collections
/collections/{collection_id}/patients
/studies
/series
/files


IDs:
----

collection_id: will actually be in the format of collection_name|site_name


Full list of endpoints:
-----------------------

/collections?...
/collections/{collection_id}
/collections/{collection_id}/patients?...
/collections/{collection_id}/patients/{patient_id}
/studies?...
/studies/{study_id}
/series?...
/series/{series_id}
/files?...
/files/{file_id}



OLD, NO LONGER VALID
Proposal (based on DICOM Web layout):
	All under /v1:

[1] /collections?...
[2] /collections/<collection_id>
[3] /collections/<collection_id>/patients?...
[4] /collections/<collection_id>/patients/<patient_id>
[5] /collections/<collection_id>/patients/<patient_id>/studies?...
[6] /collections/<collection_id>/patients/<patient_id>/studies/<study_id>
[7] /collections/<collection_id>/patients/<patient_id>/studies/<study_id>/series?...
[8] /collections/<collection_id>/patients/<patient_id>/studies/<study_id>/series/<series_id>





# file specific access
/files?...
/files/<file_id>
/files/<file_id>/dump
/files/<file_id>/download





DICOM Web Endpoints
===================

/studies?...
/studies/<study_id>
/studies/<study_id>/rendered
/studies/<study_id>/series?...
/studies/<study_id>/series/<series_id>
/studies/<study_id>/series/<series_id>/rendered
/studies/<study_id>/series/<series_id>/metadata
/studies/<study_id>/series/<series_id>/instances?...
/studies/<study_id>/series/<series_id>/instances/<instance_id>
/studies/<study_id>/series/<series_id>/instances/<instance_id>/rendered
/studies/<study_id>/series/<series_id>/instances/<instance_id>/metadata
