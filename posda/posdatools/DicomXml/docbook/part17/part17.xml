    <title>Integration of Modality Worklist and Modality Performed Procedure Step in The Original DICOM Standard (Informative)</title>
    <para>This Annex was formerly located in <olink targetdoc="PS3.3" targetptr="chapter_G" xrefstyle="template: Annex %n in PS3.3"/> in the 2003 and earlier revisions of the standard.</para>
    <para>DICOM was published in 1993 and effectively addresses image communication for a number of modalities and Image Management functions for a significant part of the field of medical imaging. Since then, many additional medical imaging specialties have contributed to the extension of the DICOM Standard and developed additional Image Object Definitions. Furthermore, there have been discussions about the harmonization of the DICOM Real-World domain model with other standardization bodies. This effort has resulted in a number of extensions to the DICOM Standard. The integration of the Modality Worklist and Modality Performed Procedure Step address an important part of the domain area that was not included initially in the DICOM Standard. At the same time, the Modality Worklist and Modality Performed Procedure Step integration make steps in the direction of harmonization with other standardization bodies (CEN TC 251, HL7, etc.).</para>
    <para>The purpose of this Annex is to show how the original DICOM Standard relates to the extension for Modality Worklist Management and Modality Performed Procedure Step. The two included figures outline the void filled by the Modality Worklist Management and Modality Performed Procedure Step specification, and the relationship between the original DICOM Data Model and the extended model.</para>

    <para>The management of a patient starts when the patient enters a physical facility (e.g., a hospital, a clinic, an imaging center) or even before that time. The DICOM Patient Management SOP Class provides many of the functions that are of interest to imaging departments. <xref linkend="figure_B-1" xrefstyle="select: label"/> is an example where one presumes that an order for a procedure has been issued for a patient. The order for an imaging procedure results in the creation of a Study Instance within the DICOM Study Management SOP Class. At the same time (A) the Modality Worklist Management SOP Class enables a modality operator to request the scheduling information for the ordered procedures. A worklist can be constructed based on the scheduling information. The handling of the requested imaging procedure in DICOM Study Management and in DICOM Worklist Management are closely related. The worklist also conveys patient/study demographic information that can be incorporated into the images.</para>
    <para>Worklist Management is completed once the imaging procedure has started and the Scheduled Procedure Step has been removed from the Worklist, possibly in response to the Modality Performed Procedure Step (B). However, Study Management continues throughout all stages of the Study, including interpretation. The actual procedure performed (based on the request) and information about the images produced are conveyed by the DICOM Study Component SOP Class or the Modality Performed Procedure Step SOP Classes.</para>

    <para><xref linkend="figure_B-2" xrefstyle="select: label"/> shows the relationship between the original DICOM Real-World model and the extensions of this Real-World model required to support the Modality Worklist and the Modality Performed Procedure Step. The new parts of the model add entities that are needed to request, schedule, and describe the performance of imaging procedures, concepts that were not supported in the original model. The entities required for representing the Worklist form a natural extension of the original DICOM Real-World model.</para>
    <para>Common to both the original model and the extended model is the Patient entity. The Service Episode is an administrative concept that has been shown in the extended model in order to pave the way for future adaptation to a common model supported by other standardization groups including HL7, CEN TC 251 WG 3, CAP-IEC, etc. The Visit is in the original model but not shown in the extended model because it is a part of the Service Episode.</para>
    <para>There is a 1 to 1 relationship between a Requested Procedure and the DICOM Study (A). A DICOM Study is the result of a single Requested Procedure. A Requested Procedure can result in only one Study.</para>
    <para>A n:m relationship exists between a Scheduled Procedure Step and a Modality Performed Procedure Step (B). The concept of a Modality Performed Procedure Step is a superset of the Study Component concept contained in the original DICOM model. The Modality Performed Procedure Step SOP Classes provide a means to relate Modality Performed Procedure Steps to Scheduled Procedure Steps.</para>

      <para>For DICOM, the domain of waveform standardization is waveform acquisition within the imaging context. It is specifically meant to address waveform acquisitions that will be analyzed with other data that is transferred and managed using the DICOM protocol. It allows the addition of waveform data to that context with minimal incremental cost. Further, it leverages the DICOM persistent object capability for maintaining referential relationships to other data collected in a multi-modality environment, including references necessary for multi-modality synchronization.</para>
      <para>Waveform interchange in other clinical contexts may use different protocols more appropriate to those domains. In particular, HL7 may be used for transfer of waveform observations to general clinical information systems, and MIB may be used for real-time physiological monitoring and therapy.</para>
      <para>The waveform information object definition in DICOM has been specifically harmonized at the semantic level with the HL7 waveform message format. The use of a common object model allows straightforward transcoding and interoperation between systems that use DICOM for waveform interchange and those that use HL7, and may be viewed as an example of common semantics implemented in the differing syntaxes of two messaging systems.</para>
      <note>
        <para>HL7 allows transport of DICOM SOP Instances (information objects) encapsulated within HL7 messages. Since the DICOM and HL7 waveform semantics are harmonized, DICOM Waveform SOP Instances need not be transported as encapsulated data, as they can be transcoded to native HL7 Waveform Observation format.</para>

          <para><emphasis role="underline">Case 1: Catheterization Laboratory</emphasis> - During a cardiac catheterization, several independent pieces of data acquisition equipment may be brought together for the exam. An electrocardiographic subsystem records surface ECG waveforms; an X-ray angiographic subsystem records motion images; a hemodynamic subsystem records intracardiac pressures from a sensor on the catheter. These subsystems send their acquired data by network to a repository. These data are assembled at an analytic workstation by retrieving from the repository. For a left ventriculographic procedure, the ECG is used by the physician to determine the time of maximum and minimum ventricular fill, and when coordinated with the angiographic images, an accurate estimate of the ejection fraction can be calculated. For a valvuloplasty procedure, the hemodynamic waveforms are used to calculate the pre-intervention and post-intervention pressure gradients.</para>

      <para>A second method of synchronizing acquisitions is to utilize a common reference channel (temporal fiducial), which is recorded in the data acquired from the several equipment units participating in a study, and/or that is used to trigger synchronized data acquisitions. For instance, the "X-ray on" pulse train that triggers the acquisition of frames for an X-ray angiographic SOP Instance can be recorded as a waveform channel in a simultaneously acquired hemodynamic waveform SOP Instance, and can be used to align the different object instances. Associated with this Supplement are proposed coded entry channel identifiers to specifically support this synchronization mechanism (DICOM Terminology Mapping Resource Context Group ID 3090).</para>

      <title>Waveform Acquisition Model</title>
      <para><xref linkend="figure_C.4-1" xrefstyle="select: label"/> shows a canonical model of waveform data acquisition. A patient is the subject of the study. There may be several sensors placed at different locations on or in the patient, and waveforms are measurements of some physical quality (metric) by those sensors (e.g., electrical voltage, pressure, gas concentration, or sound). The sensor is typically connected to an amplifier and filter, and its output is sampled at constant time intervals and digitized. In most cases, several signal channels are acquired synchronously. The measured signal usually originates in the anatomy of the patient, but an important special case is a signal that originates in the equipment, either as a stimulus, such as a cardiac pacing signal, as a therapy, such as a radio frequency signal used for ablation, or as a synchronization signal.</para>

        <title>Annotation</title>
        <para>In HL7, Waveform Annotation is sent in an OBX Segment of subtype ANO, using the CE (Coded Entry) Data Type CE. This corresponds precisely to the DICOM Annotation using Coded Entry Sequences. However, HL7 annotation ROI is to a single point only (time reference), while DICOM allows reference to ranges of samples delimited by time or by explicit sample position.</para>

      <title>Harmonization With SCP-ECG</title>
      <para>The SCP-ECG standard is designed for recording routine resting electrocardiograms. Such ECGs are reviewed prior to cardiac imaging procedures, and a typical use case would be for SCP-ECG waveforms to be translated to DICOM for inclusion with the full cardiac imaging patient record.</para>
      <para>SCP-ECG provides for either simultaneous or non-simultaneous recording of the channels, but does not provide a multiplexed data format (each channel is separately encoded). When translating to DICOM, each subset of simultaneously recorded channels may be encoded in a Waveform Sequence Item (multiplex group), and the delay to the recording of each multiplex group shall be encoded in the Multiplex Group Time Offset (0018,1068).</para>
      <para>The electrode configuration of SCP-ECG Section 1 may be translated to the DICOM Acquisition Context (0040,0555) sequence items using <olink targetdoc="PS3.16" targetptr="sect_TID_3401" xrefstyle="select: labelnumber quotedtitle"/> and Context Groups 3263 and 3264.</para>
      <para>The lead identification of SCP-ECG Section 3, a term coded as an unsigned integer, may be translated to the DICOM Waveform Channel Source (003A,0208) coded sequence using <olink targetdoc="PS3.16" targetptr="sect_CID_3001" xrefstyle="select: labelnumber quotedtitle"/>.</para>
      <para>Pacemaker spike records of SCP-ECG Section 7 may be translated to items in the Waveform Annotations Sequence (0040,B020) with a code term from <olink targetdoc="PS3.16" targetptr="sect_CID_3335" xrefstyle="select: labelnumber quotedtitle"/>. The annotation sequence item may record the spike amplitude in its Numeric Value and Measurement Units attributes.</para>

      <para>The Summary of Detections and Summary of Analyses sub-trees identify the algorithms used and the work done by the CAD device, and whether or not each process was performed on one or more entire images or selected regions of images. The findings of the detections and analyses are not encoded in the summary sub-trees, but rather in the CAD Processing and Findings Summary sub-tree. CAD processing may produce no findings, in which case the sub-trees of the CAD Processing and Findings Summary sub-tree are incompletely populated. This occurs in the following situations:</para>

        <title>Example 2: Calcification and Mass Detection With Findings</title>
        <para>A mammography CAD device processes a screening mammography case with four films and a mass in the left breast. Mammography CAD runs both density and calcification detection successfully. It finds two densities in the LCC, one density in the LMLO, a cluster of two calcifications in the RCC and a cluster of 20 calcifications in the RMLO. It performs two clustering algorithms. One identifies individual calcifications and then clusters them, and the second simply detects calcification clusters. It performs mass correlation and combines one of the LCC densities and the LMLO density into a mass; the other LCC density is flagged Not for Presentation, therefore not intended for display to the end-user. The mammograms resemble:</para>

      <title>CAD Operating Point</title>
      <para>Computer-aided detection algorithms often compute an internal "CAD score" for each Single Image Finding detected by the algorithm. In some implementations the algorithms then group the findings into "bins" as a function of their CAD score. The number of bins is a function of the algorithm and the manufacturer's implementation, and must be one or more. The bins allow an application that is displaying CAD marks to provide a number of operating points on the Free-response Receiver-Operating Characteristic (FROC) curve for the algorithm, as illustrated in <xref linkend="figure_E.4-1" xrefstyle="select: label"/>.</para>

        <para>The patient in Example 3 is called back for CT to confirm the Lung Nodule found in Example 3. The patient undergoes CT of the Thorax and the initial chest radiograph and CT slices are sent to a more comprehensive CAD device for processing. Findings are detected and analyses are performed that correlate findings from the two data sets. Portions of the prior CAD report (Example 3) are incorporated into this report.</para>

    <title>Explanation of Grouping Criteria For Multi-frame Functional Group IODs (Informative)</title>
    <para>This Annex was formerly located in <olink targetdoc="PS3.3" targetptr="chapter_N" xrefstyle="template: Annex %n in PS3.3"/> in the 2003 and earlier revisions of the standard.</para>
    <para>When considering how to group an attribute, one needs to consider first of all whether or not the values of an attribute are different per frame. The reasons to consider whether to allow an attribute to change include:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>The more attributes that change, the more parsing a receiving application has to do in order to determine if the multi-frame object has frames the application should deal with. The more choices, the more complex the application becomes, potentially resulting in interoperability problems.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>The frequency of change of an attribute must also be considered. If an attribute could be changed every frame then obviously it is not a very good candidate for making it fixed, since this would result in a multi-frame size of 1.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>The number of applications that depend on frame level attribute grouping is another consideration. For example, one might imagine a pulse sequence being changed in a real-time acquisition, but the vast majority of acquisitions would leave this constant. Therefore, it was judged not too large a burden to force an acquisition device to start a new object when this happens. Obviously, this is a somewhat subjective decision, and one should take a close look at the attributes that are required to be fixed in this document.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>The attributes from the image pixel module must not change in a multi-frame object due to legacy tool kits and implementations.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>The potential frequency of change is dependent on the applications both now and likely during the life of this standard. The penalty for failure to allow an attribute to change is rather high since it will be hard/impossible to change later. Making an attribute variable that is static is more complex and could result in more header space usage depending on how it is grouped. Thus there is a trade-off of complexity and potentially header size with not being able to take advantage of the multi-frame organization for an application that requires changes per frame.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>Once it is decided which attributes should be changed within a multi-frame object then one needs to consider the criteria for grouping attributes together:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Groupings should be designed so those attributes that are likely to vary together should be in the same sequence. The goal is to avoid the case where attributes that are mostly static have to be included in a sequence that is repeated for every frame.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Care should be taken so that we define a manageable number of grouping sequences. Too few sequences could result in many static attributes being repeated for each frame, when some other element in their sequence was varying, and too many sequences becomes unwieldy.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>The groupings should be designed such that modality independent attributes are kept separate from those that are MR specific. This will presumably allow future working groups to reuse the more general groupings. It also should allow software that operates on multi-frame objects from multiple objects maximize code reuse.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Grouping related attributes together could convey some semantics of the overall contents of the multi-frame object to receiving applications. For instance, if a volumetric application finds the Plane Orientation Macro present in the Per-frame Functional Groups Sequence, it may decide to reject the object as inappropriate for volumetric calculations.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>Specific notes on attribute grouping:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Attributes not allowed to change: Image Pixel Module (due to legacy toolkit concerns); and Pulse Sequence Module attributes (normally do not change except in real-time - it is expected real time applications can handle the complexity and speed of starting new IODs when pulse sequence changes).</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Sequences not starting with the word "MR" could be applied to more modalities than just MR.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>All attributes that must be in a frame header were placed in the Frame Content Macro.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Position and orientation are in separate sequences since they are changed independently.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>For real-time sequences there are contrast mechanisms that can be applied to base pulse sequences and are turned on and off by the operator depending on the anatomy being imaged and the time/contrast trade-off associated with these. Such modifiers include: IR, flow compensation, spoiled, MT, and T2 preparation… These probably are not changed in non-real-time scans. These are all kept in the MR Modifier Macro.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>"Number of Averages" attributes is in its own sequence because real-time applications may start a new averaging process every time a slice position/orientation changes. Each subsequent frame will average with the preceding N frames where N is chosen based on motion and time. Each frame collected at a particular position/orientation will have a different number of averages, but all other attributes are likely to remain the same. This particular application drives this attribute being in its own group.</para>

    <para>The Clinical Trial Identification modules are optional. As such, there are several points in the workflow of clinical trial data at which the Clinical Trial Identification attributes may be added to the data. At the Clinical Trial Site, the attributes may be added at the scanner, a PACS system, a site workstation, or a workstation provided to the site by a Clinical Trial Coordinating Center. If not added at the site, the Clinical Trial Identification attributes may be added to the data after receipt by the Clinical Trial Coordinating Center. The addition of clinical trial attributes does not itself require changes to the SOP Instance UID. However, the clinical trial protocol or the process of de-identification may require such a change.</para>

      <para>Images are obtained for the purpose of comparing patients treated with placebo or the drug under test, then evaluated in a blinded manner by a team of radiologists at the Clinical Trial Coordinating Center (CTCC). The images are obtained at the clinical sites, collected by the CTCC, at which time their identifying attributes are removed and the Clinical Trial Identification (CTI) module is added. The de-identified images with the CTI information are then presented to the radiologists who make quantitative and/or qualitative assessments. The assessments, and in some cases the images, are returned to the sponsor for analysis, and later are contributed to the submission to the regulating authority.</para>

      <para>A common OB-GYN pattern is that of several instances of one measurement type (e.g., BPD), the calculated average of those values, and derived values such as a gestational age calculated according to an equation or table. The measurements and calculations are all siblings in the measurement group. A child content item specifies the equation or table used to calculate the gestational age. All measurement types must relate to the same biometric type. For example, it is not allowed to mix a BPD and a Nuchal Fold Thickness measurement in the same biometry group.</para>

      <para>The example above is a gestational age calculated from the measured value. The relationship is to an equation or table. The inferred from relationship identifies equation or table in the Concept Name.

      <para>Another use case is the calculation of a growth parameter's relationship to that of a referenced distribution and a known or assumed gestational age. <olink targetdoc="PS3.16" targetptr="sect_CID_12015" xrefstyle="select: labelnumber quotedtitle"/> identify the growth table. <xref linkend="figure_I.6-2" xrefstyle="select: label"/> shows the assignment of a percentile for the measured BPD, against the growth of a referenced population. The dependency relationship to the gestational age is a by-reference relationship to the established gestational age. Though the percentile rank is derived from the BPD measurement, a by-reference relationship is not essential if one BPD has a concept modifier indicating that it is the mean or has selection status (see <olink targetdoc="PS3.16" targetptr="sect_TID_300" xrefstyle="select: labelnumber quotedtitle"/>). A variation of this pattern is the use of Z-score instead of percentile rank. Not shown is the expression of the normal distribution mean, standard deviation, or confidence limits.</para>

    <title>Handling of Identifying Parameters (Informative)</title>
    <para>This Annex was formerly located in <olink targetdoc="PS3.4" targetptr="chapter_M" xrefstyle="template: Annex %n in PS3.4"/> in the 2003 and earlier revisions of the standard.</para>

      <title>Purpose of This Annex</title>
      <para>The DICOM Standard was published in 1993 and addresses medical images communication between medical modalities, workstations and other medical devices as well as data exchange between medical devices and the Information System (IS). DICOM defines SOP Instances with Patient, Visit and Study information managed by the Information System and allows to communicate the Attribute values of these objects.</para>
      <para>Since the publication of the DICOM Standard great effort has been made to harmonize the Information Model of the DICOM Standard with the models of other relevant standards, especially with the HL7 model and the CEN TC 251 WG3 PT 022 model. The result of these effort is a better understanding of the various practical situations in hospitals and an adaptation of the model to these situations. In the discussion of models, the definition of Information Entities and their Identifying Parameters play a very important role.</para>
      <para>The purpose of this Informative Annex is to show which identifying parameters may be included in Image SOP Instances and their related Modality Performed Procedure Step (MPPS) SOP Instance. Different scenarios are elucidated to describe varying levels of integration of the Modality with the Information System, as well as situations in which a connection is temporarily unavailable.</para>
      <note>
        <para>In this Annex, "Image SOP Instance" is used as a collective term for all Composite Image Storage SOP Instances.</para>
      </note>
      <para>The scenarios described here are informative and do not constitute a normative section of the DICOM Standard.</para>

    <section label="J.2" status="2" xml:id="sect_J.2">
      <title>Integrated Environment</title>
      <para>"Integrated" means in this context that the Acquisition Modality is connected to an Information System or Systems that may be an SCP of the Modality Worklist SOP Class or an SCP of the Modality Performed Procedure Step SOP Class or both. In the following description only the behavior of "Modalities" is mentioned, it goes without saying that the IS must conform to the same SOP Classes.</para>
      <para>The Modality receives identifying parameters by querying the Modality Worklist SCP and generates other Attribute values during image generation. It is desirable that these identifying parameters be included in the Image SOP Instances as well as in the MPPS object in a consistent manner. In the case of a Modality that is integrated but unable to receive or send identifying parameters, e.g., link down, emergency case, the Modality may behave as if it were not integrated.</para>
      <para>The Study Instance UID is a crucial Attribute that is used to relate Image SOP Instances (whose Study is identified by their Study Instance UID), the Modality PPS SOP Instance that contains it as a reference, and the actual or conceptual Requested Procedure (i.e., Study) and related Imaging Service Request in the IS. An IS that manages an actual or conceptual Detached Study Management entity is expected to be able to relate this Study Instance UID to the SOP Instance UID of the Detached Study Management SOP Instance, whether or not the Study Instance UID is provided by the IS or generated by the modality.</para>

      <title>Purpose of this Annex</title>
      <para>The purpose of this annex is to enhance consistency and interoperability among creators and consumers of Ultrasound images within Staged Protocol Exams. An ultrasound "Staged Protocol Exam" is an exam that acquires a set of images under specified conditions during time intervals called "Stages". An example of such an exam is a cardiac stress-echo Staged Protocol.</para>
      <para>This informative annex describes the use of ultrasound Staged Protocol attributes within the following DICOM Services: Ultrasound Image, Ultrasound Multi-frame Image, and Key Object Selection Storage, Modality Worklist, and Modality Performed Procedure Step Services.</para>

    <section label="K.2" status="2" xml:id="sect_K.2">
      <title>Prerequisites For Support</title>
      <para>The support of ultrasound Staged Protocol Data Management requires support for the Ultrasound Image SOP Class or Ultrasound Multi-frame Image SOP Class as appropriate for the nature of the Protocol. By supporting some optional Elements of these SOP Classes, Staged-Protocols can be managed. Support of Key Object Selection allows control of the order of View and Stage presentation. Support of Modality Worklist Management and Modality Performed Procedure Step allow control over specific workflow use cases as described in this Annex.</para>

      <title>Definition of a Staged Protocol Exam</title>
      <para>A "Staged Protocol Exam" acquires images in two or more distinct time intervals called "Stages" with a consistent set of images called "Views" acquired during each Stage of the exam. A View is of a particular cross section of the anatomy acquired with a specific ultrasound transducer position and orientation. During the acquisition of a Staged Protocol Exam, the modality may also acquire non-Protocol images at one or more Protocol Stages.</para>
      <para>A common real-world example of an ultrasound Staged Protocol exam is a cardiac stress-echo ultrasound exam. Images are acquired in distinct time intervals (Stages) of different levels of stress and Views as shown in <xref linkend="figure_K.3-1" xrefstyle="select: label"/>. Typically, stress is induced by means of patient exercise or medication. Typical Stages for such an exam are baseline, mid-stress, peak-stress, and recovery. During the baseline Stage the patient is at rest, prior to inducing stress through medication or exercise. At mid-stress Stage the heart is under a moderate level of stress. During peak-stress Stage the patient's heart experiences maximum stress appropriate for the patient's condition. Finally, during the recovery Stage, the heart recovers because the source of stress is absent.</para>
      <para>At each Stage an equivalent set of Views is acquired. Examples of typical Views are parasternal long axis and parasternal short axis. Examination of wall motion between the corresponding Views of different Stages may reveal ischemia of one or more regions ("segments") of the myocardium. <xref linkend="figure_K.3-1" xrefstyle="select: label"/> illustrates the typical results of a cardiac stress-echo ultrasound exam.</para>

        <para>The attributes Protocol Name (0018,1030) and Performed Protocol Code Sequence (0040,0260) identify the Protocol of a Staged Protocol Exam, but the mere presence of one or both of these attributes does not in itself identify the acquisition as a Staged Protocol Exam. If both Protocol Name and Performed Protocol Code Sequence attributes are present, the Protocol Name value takes precedence over the Performed Protocol Code Sequence Code Meaning value as a display label for the Protocol, since the Protocol Name would convey the institutional preference better than the standardized code meaning.</para>

        <title>Stage and View Identification</title>
        <para>Display devices usually include capabilities that aid in the organization and presentation of images acquired as part of the Staged Protocol. These capabilities allow a clinician to display images of a given View acquired during different Stages of the Protocol side by side for comparison. A View is a particular combination of the transducer position and orientation at the time of image acquisition. Images are acquired at the same View in different Protocol Stages for the purpose of comparison. For these features to work properly, the display device must be able to determine the Stage and View of each image in an unambiguous fashion.</para>

        <para>The use of code sequences to identify Stage and View, using Context Group values specified in <olink targetdoc="PS3.16" targetptr="PS3.16" xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/> (e.g., <olink targetdoc="PS3.16" targetptr="sect_CID_12002" xrefstyle="select: labelnumber quotedtitle"/> and <olink targetdoc="PS3.16" targetptr="sect_CID_12226" xrefstyle="select: labelnumber quotedtitle"/>), allows a display application with knowledge of the code semantics to render a display in accordance with clinical domain uses and user preferences (e.g., populating each quadrant of an echocardiographic display with the user desired stage and view). The IHE Echocardiography Workflow Profile requires such use of code sequences for stress-echo studies.</para>

        <title>Extra-protocol Image Identification</title>
        <para>At any Stage of a Staged Protocol exam, the operator may acquire images that are not part of the Protocol. These images are so-called "extra-Protocol images". Information regarding the performed Protocol is still included because such images are acquired in the same Procedure Step as the Protocol images. The Stage number and optionally other Stage identification attributes (Stage Name and/or Stage Code Sequence) should still be conveyed in extra-Protocol images. However, the View number should be omitted to signify that the image is not one of the standard Views in the Protocol. Other View identifying information, such as name or code sequences, may indicate the image location.</para>

          <para>A special case arises when the acquisition during a Protocol Stage is halted for some reason. For example, such a situation can occur if signs of patient distress are observed, such as angina in a cardiac stress exam. These criteria are part of the normal exam Protocol, and as long as the conditions defined for the Protocol are met the MPPS status is set to COMPLETED. Only if the exam terminates before meeting the minimum acquisition requirements of the selected Protocol would MPPS status be set to DISCONTINUED. It is recommended that the reason for discontinuation should be conveyed in the Modality Procedure Step Discontinuation Reason Code Sequence (0040,0281). Staged Protocols generally include criteria for ending the exam, such as when a target time duration is reached or if signs of patient distress are observed.</para>
          <para>If a Protocol Stage is to be acquired at a later time with the intention of using an earlier completed Protocol Stage of a halted Staged Protocol then a new Scheduled Procedure Step may or may not be created for this additional acquisition. Workflow management recommendations vary depending on whether the care institution decides to create a new Scheduled Procedure Step or not.</para>
          <para>Follow-up Stages must use View Numbers, Names, and Code Sequences identical to those in the prior Stages to enable automatically correlating images of the original and follow-up Stages.</para>

          <para>Follow-up Stages require a separate MPPS. Since follow-up stages are part of the same Requested Procedure and Scheduled Procedure Step, all acquired image SOP Instances and generated MPPS instances specify the same Study Instance UID. If the Study Instance UID is different, systems will have difficulty associating related images. This creates a significant problem if Modality Worklist is not supported. Therefore systems should assign the same Study Instance UID for follow-up Stages even if Modality Worklist is not supported. <xref linkend="figure_K.5.5-2" xrefstyle="select: label"/> shows a possible interaction sequence for this scenario.</para>

            <para>In some cases a new Scheduled Procedure Step is created to acquire follow-up Stages. For example, a drug induced stress-echo exam may be scheduled because an earlier exercise induced stress-echo exam had to be halted due to patient discomfort. In such cases it would be redundant to reacquire earlier Stages such as the rest Stage of a cardiac stress-echo ultrasound exam. One MPPS contains the Image instances of the original Stage and a separate MPSS contains the follow-up instances.</para>

    <para>The Hemodynamics Report is based on <olink targetdoc="PS3.16" targetptr="sect_TID_3500" xrefstyle="select: labelnumber quotedtitle"/>.

    <para>The container for each phase has an optional subsidiary container for Clinical Context with a parent-child relationship of has-acquisition-context. This Clinical Context container allows the recording of pertinent patient state information that may be essential to understanding the measurements made during that procedure phase. It should be noted that any such patient state information is necessarily only a summary; a more complete clinical picture may be obtained by review of the cath procedure log.</para>
    <para>The lowest level containers for the measurement sets are specialized by the class of anatomic location - arterial, venous, atrial, ventricular - for the particular measurements appropriate to that type of location. These containers explicitly identify the anatomic location with a has-acquisition-context relationship. Since such measurement sets are typically measured on the same source (e.g., pressure waveform), the container may also have a has-acquisition-context relationship with a source DICOM waveform SOP Instance.</para>
    <para>The "atomic" level of measurements within the measurement set containers includes three types of data. First is the 
    <emphasis role="italic">specific measurement data</emphasis> acquired from waveforms related to the site. Second is 
    <emphasis role="italic">general measurement data</emphasis> that may include any hemodynamic, patient vital sign, or blood chemistry data. Third,

      <para>The vascular procedure report partitions numeric measurements into section headings by anatomic region and by laterality. A laterality concept modifier of the section heading concept name specifies whether laterality is left or right. Therefore, laterally paired anatomy sections may appear two times, once for each laterality. Findings of unpaired anatomy, are separately contained in a separate "unilateral" section container. Therefore, in vascular ultrasound, laterality is always expressed at the section heading level with one of three states: left, right, or unilateral (unpaired). There is no provision for anatomy of unknown laterality other than as a TEXT content item in the summary.</para>
      <para>Note that expressing laterality at the heading level differs from OB-GYN Pelvic and fetal vasculature, which expresses laterality as concept modifiers of the anatomic containers.</para>

      <para>The content of this section provides recommendations on how to express the concepts from draft ASE guidelines with measurement type concept names and concept name modifiers.</para>
      <para>The leftmost column is the name of the ASE concept. The Base Measurement Concept Name is the concept name of the numeric measurement content item. The modifiers column specifies a set of modifiers for the base measurement concept name. Each modifier consists of a modifier concept name (e.g., method or mode) and its value (e.g., Continuity). Where no Concept Modifier appears, the base concept matches the ASE concept.</para>

      <title>Spatial Registration and Spatial Fiducials SOP Classes</title>
      <para>These SOP Classes allow describing spatial relationships between sets of images. Each instance can describe any number of registrations as shown in <xref linkend="figure_O.1-1" xrefstyle="select: label"/>. It may also reference prior registration instances that contribute to the creation of the registrations in the instance.</para>
      <para>A Reference Coordinate System (RCS) is a spatial Frame of Reference described by the DICOM Frame of Reference Module. The chosen Frame of Reference of the Registration SOP Instance may be the same as one or more of the Referenced SOP Instances. In this case, the Frame of Reference UID (0020,0052) is the same, as shown by the Registered RCS in the figure. The registration information is a sequence of spatial transformations, potentially including deformation information. The composite of the specified spatial transformations defines the complete transformation from one RCS to the other.</para>
      <para>Image instances may have no DICOM Frame of Reference, in which case the registration is to that single image (or frame, in the case of a multi-frame image). The Spatial Registration IOD may also be used to establish a coordinate system for an image that has no defined Frame of Reference. To do this, the center of the top left pixel of the source image is treated as being located at (0, 0, 0). Offsets from the first pixel are computed using the resolution specified in the Source IOD. Multiplying that coordinate by the Transformation matrix gives the patient coordinate in the new Frame of Reference.</para>
      <para>A special case is an atlas. DICOM has defined Well-Known Frame of Reference UIDs for several common atlases. There is not necessarily image data associated with an atlas.</para>
      <para>When using the Spatial Registration or Deformable Registration SOP Classes there are two types of coordinate systems. The coordinate system of the referenced data is the 
      <emphasis role="italic">Source RCS</emphasis>. The coordinate system established by the SOP instance is the 
      <emphasis role="italic">Registered RCS</emphasis>.</para>
      <para>The sense of the direction of transformation differs between the Spatial Registration SOP Class and the Deformable Spatial Registration SOP Class. The Spatial Registration SOP Class specifies a transformation that maps Source coordinates, in the Source RCS, to Registered coordinates, in the Registered RCS. The Deformable Spatial Registration SOP Class specifies transformations that map Registered coordinates, in the Registered RCS, to coordinates in the Source RCS.</para>
      <para>The Spatial Fiducials SOP Class stores spatial fiducials as implicit registration information.</para>

      <title>Functional Use Cases</title>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Multi-Modality Fusion:</emphasis> A workstation or modality performs a registration of images from independent acquisition modalities-PET, CT, MR, NM, and US-from multiple series. The workstation stores the registration data for subsequent visualization and image processing. Such visualization may include side-by-side synchronized display, or overlay (fusion) of one modality image on the display of another. The processes for such fusion are beyond the scope of the Standard. The workstation may also create and store a ready-for-display fused image, which references both the source image instances and the registration instance that describes their alignment.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Prior Study Fusion:</emphasis> Using post processing or a manual process, a workstation creates a spatial object registration of the current Study's Series from prior Studies for comparative evaluation.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Atlas Mapping:</emphasis> A workstation or a CAD device specifies fiducials of anatomical features in the brain such as the anterior commissure, posterior commissure, and points that define the hemispheric fissure plane. The system stores this information in the Spatial Fiducials SOP Instance. Subsequent retrieval of the fiducials enables a device or workstation to register the patient images to a functional or anatomical atlas, presenting the atlas information as overlays.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">CAD:</emphasis> A CAD device creates fiducials of features during the course of the analysis. It stores the locations of the fiducials for future analysis in another imaging procedure. In the subsequent CAD procedure, the CAD device performs a new analysis on the new data set. As before, it creates comparable fiducials, which it may store in a Spatial Fiducials SOP Instance. The CAD device then performs additional analysis by registering the images of the current exam to the prior exam. It does so by correlating the fiducials of the prior and current exam. The CAD device may store the registration in Registration SOP Instance.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Adaptive Radiotherapy:</emphasis> A CT Scan is taken to account for variations in patient position prior to radiation therapy. A workstation performs the registration of the most recent image data to the prior data, corrects the plan, and stores the registration and revised plan.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Image Stitching:</emphasis> An acquisition device captures multiple images, e.g., DX images down a limb. A user identifies fiducials on each of the images. The system stores these in one or more Fiducial SOP Instances. Then the images are "stitched" together algorithmically by means that utilize the Fiducial SOP Instances as input. The result is a single image and optionally a Registration SOP Instance that indicates how the original images can be transformed to a location on the final image.</para>

      <title>Matrix Registration</title>
      <para>A 4x4 affine transformation matrix describes spatial rotation, translation, scale changes and affine transformations that register referenced images to the Registration IE's homogeneous RCS. These steps are expressible in a single matrix, or as a sequence of multiple independent rotations, translations, or scaling, each expressed in a separate matrix. Normally, registrations are rigid body, involving only rotation and translation. Changes in scale or affine transformations occur in atlas registration or to correct minor mismatches.</para>

      <title>Spatial Fiducials</title>
      <para>Fiducials are image-derived reference markers of location, orientation, or scale. These may be labeled points or collections of points in a data volume that specify a shape. Most commonly, fiducials are individual points.</para>
      <para>Correlated fiducials of separate image sets may serve as inputs to a registration process to estimate the spatial registration between similar objects in the images. The correlation may, or may not, be expressed in the fiducial identifiers. A fiducial identifier may be an arbitrary number or text string to uniquely identify each fiducial from others in the set. In this case, fiducial correlation relies on operator recognition and control.</para>
      <para>Alternatively, coded concepts may identify the acquired fiducials so that systems can automatically correlate them. Examples of such coded concepts are points of a stereotactic frame, prosthesis points, or well-resolved anatomical landmarks such as bicuspid tips. Such codes could be established and used locally by a department, over a wider area by a society or research study coordinator, or from a standardized set.</para>
      <para>The table below shows each case of identifier encoding. A and B represent two independent registrations: one to some image set A, and the other to image set B.</para>

Some people utilize the DHCP database as a documentation tool for documenting the assignment of IP addresses that are preset on equipment. This does not interfere with DHCP operation and can make a gradual transition from equipment presets to DHCP assignments easier. It also helps avoid accidental re-use of IP addresses that are already manually assigned. However, DHCP does not verify that these entries are in fact correct.</para>

During initial device installation it is likely that the LDAP database lacks information regarding the device.

              <para>Each of the Network AE objects is created by means of the LDAP object creation process. It is at this point that LDAP determines whether the AE Title is in fact unique among all AE Titles. If the title is unique, the creation succeeds. If there is a conflict, the creation fails and "name already in use" is given as a reasonless uses propose/create as an atomic operation for creating unique items. The LDAP approach permits unique titles that comply with algorithms for structured names, check digits, etc. DICOM does not require structured names, but they are a commonplace requirement for other LDAP users. It may take multiple attempts to find an unused name. This multiple probe behavior can be a problem if "unconfigured device" is a common occurrence and name collisions are common. Name collisions can be minimized at the expense of name structure by selecting names such as "AExxxxxxxxxxxxxx" where "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx" is a truly randomly selected number. The odds of
          collision are then exceedingly small, and a unique name will be found within one or two probes.</para>

The computer processing costs for NTP are insignificant for a PC, but may be burdensome for very small devices. The SNTP synchronization errors are only a few milliseconds in a LAN environment. They are very topology sensitive and errors may become huge in a WAN environment.</para>
          <para>Most NTP servers are in turn NTP clients to multiple superior servers and peers. NTP is designed to accommodate a hierarchy of server/clients that distributes time information from a few international standard clocks out through layers of servers.</para>

            <emphasis role="bold">External NTP servers</emphasis>
          </para>
          <para>Many ISPs and government agencies offer access to NTP servers that are in turn synchronized with the international standard clocks. This access is usually offered on a restricted basis.</para>
          <para>
            <emphasis role="bold">External clock broadcasts</emphasis>
          </para>
          <para>The US, Canada, Germany, and others offer radio broadcasts of time signals that may be used by local receivers attached to an NTP server. The US and Russia broadcast time signals from satellites, e.g., GPS. Some mobile telephone services broadcast time signals. These signals are synchronized with the international standard clocks. GPS time signals are popular worldwide time sources. Their primary problem is difficulties with proper antenna location and receiver cost. Most of the popular low cost consumer GPS systems save money by sacrificing the clock accuracy.</para>
          <para>
            <emphasis role="bold">External pulse sources</emphasis>
          </para>
          <para>For extremely high accuracy synchronization, atomic clocks can be attached to NTP servers. These clocks do not provide a time estimate, but they provide a pulse signal that is known to be extremely accurate. The optimal estimation logic can use this in combination with other external sources to achieve sub microsecond synchronization to a reference clock even when the devices are separated by the earth's diameter.</para>
          <para>The details regarding selecting an external clock source and appropriate use of the clock source are outside the scope of the NTP protocol. They are often discussed and documented in conjunction with the NTP protocol and many such interfaces are included in the reference implementation of NTP.</para>

        <title>SNTP Restrictions</title>
        <para>In theory, servers can be SNTP servers and NTP servers can be SNTP clients of other servers. This is very strongly discouraged. The SNTP errors can be substantial, and the clients of a server using SNTP will not have the statistical information needed to assess the magnitude of these errors. It is feasible for SNTP clients to use NTP servers. The SNTP protocol packets are identical to the NTP protocol packets. SNTP differs in that some of the statistical information fields are filled with nominal SNTP values instead of having actual measured values.</para>

        <title>Implementation Considerations</title>
        <para>There are several public reference implementations of NTP server and client software available. These are in widespread use and have been ported to many platforms (including Unix, Windows, and Macintosh). There are also proprietary and built-in NTP services for some platforms (e.g., Windows 2000). The public reference implementations include sample interfaces to many kinds of external clock sources.</para>
        <para>There are significant performance considerations in the selection of locations for servers and clients. Devices that need high accuracy synchronization should probably be all on the same LAN together with an NTP server on that LAN.</para>
        <para>Real time operating system (RTOS) implementations may have greater difficulties. The reference NTP implementations have been ported to several RTOSs. There were difficulties with the implementations of the internal system clock on the RTOS. The dual frequency/phase adjustment requirements may require the clock functions to be rewritten. The reference implementations also require access to a separate high resolution interval timer (with sub microsecond accuracy and precision). This is a standard CPU feature for modern workstation processors, but may be missing on low end processors.</para>
        <para>An RTOS implementation with only ordinary synchronization requirements might choose to write their own SNTP only implementation rather than use the reference NTP implementation. The SNTP client is very simple. It may be based on the reference implementation or written from scratch. The operating system support needed for accurate adjustment is optional for SNTP clients. The only requirement is the time base stability requirement, which usually implies the ability to specify fractional seconds when setting the time.</para>
        <para>The conflict between the user desire to use local time and the NTP use of UTC must be resolved in the device. DHCP offers the ability to obtain the offset between local time and UTC dynamically, provided the DHCP server supports this option. There remain issues such as service procedures, start up in the absence of DHCP, etc.</para>
        <para>The differences between local time, UTC, summer time, etc. are a common source of confusion and errors setting the battery clock. The NTP algorithms will eventually resolve these errors, but the final convergence on correct time may be significantly delayed. The device might be ready for medical use before these errors are resolved.</para>

    <title>Legacy Transition For Configuration Management (Informative)</title>
    <para>There will usually be a period of time where a network will have some applications that utilize the configuration management protocols coexisting with applications that are only manually configured. The transition issues arise when a legacy Association Requester interacts with a managed Association Acceptor or when a managed Association Requester interacts with a legacy Association Acceptor.

Most DHCP servers support the definition of pre-allocated static IP addresses. The unmanaged nodes can be documented by including entries for static IP addresses for the unmanaged nodes.

      <para>A vessel segment length as seen in the image is not always indicated as the same X-axis difference in the graph.</para>
      <para>The X-axis of the graph is based on pixel positions on the midline and these points are not necessarily equidistant. This is caused by the fact that vessels do not only run perfectly horizontally or vertically, but also at angles.</para>
      <para>When a vessel midline is covering a number of pixel positions perfectly horizontal or vertical, it will cover less space in mm compared to a vessel that covers the same number of pixel positions under an angle. When a segment runs perfectly horizontal or vertical, the segment length is equal to the amount of midline pixel points times the pixel separation (each point of the midline is separated exactly the pixel spacing in mm) and the points on the X-axis also represent exactly one pixel space. This is not the case when the vessel runs under an angle. For example an artery that is positioned at a 45 angle, the distance between two points on the midline is 0.7 times the pixel spacing.</para>
      <para>As example, the artery consists of 10 elements (n =10); each has a length of 1mm (pixel size). If the MLD was exactly in the center of the artery you would expect the length from 0 to the MLD would be 5 sub segments long, thus 5 mm. This is true if the artery runs horizontal or vertically (assumed aspect ratio is 1).</para>

      <para>To provide analogy to ultrasound imaging, the terms A-scan and B-scan are used to describe optical tomography images. In this setting, an A-scan is the image acquired by passing a single beam of light through the structure of interest. An A-scan image represents the optical reflectivity of the imaged tissue along the path of that beam - a one-dimensional view through the structure. A B-scan is then created from a collection of adjacent A-scan images - a two dimensional image. It is also possible to combine multiple B-scans into a 3-dimensional image of the tissue.</para>
      <para>When using optical tomography in the eye it is desirable to have information about the anatomic and physiologic state of the eye. Measurements like the patient's refractive error and axial eye length are frequently important for calculating magnification or minification of images. The accommodative state and application of pupil dilating medications are important when imaging the anterior segment of the eye as they each cause shifts in the relative positions of ocular structures. The use of dilating medications is also relevant when imaging posterior segment structures because a small pupil can account for poor image quality.</para>

          <para>Some color retinal imaging studies are done to determine vascular caliber of retinal vessels, which can vary throughout the cardiac cycle. Images are captured while connected to an ECG machine or a cardiac pulse monitor allowing image acquisition to be synchronized to the cardiac cycle.</para>
          <para>Angiography is a procedure that requires a dye to be injected into the patient for the purpose of enhancing the imaging of vascular structures in the eye. A standard step in this procedure is imaging the eye at specified intervals to detect the pooling of small amounts of dye and/or blood in the retina. For a doctor or technician to properly interpret angiography images it is important to know how much time had elapsed between the dye being injected in the patient (time 0) and the image frame being taken. It is known that such dyes can have an affect on OPT tomographic images as well (and it may be possible to use such dyes to enhance vascular structure in the OPT images), therefore time synchronization will be applied to the creation of the OPT images as well as any associated OP images</para>
          <para>The angiographic acquisition is instantiated as a multi-frame OPT Image. The variable time increments between frames of the image are captured in the Frame Time Vector of the OPT Multi-frame Module. For multiple sets of images, e.g., sets of retinal scan images, the Slice Location Vector will be used in addition to the Frame Time Vector. For 5 sets of 6 scans there will be 30 frames in the multi-frame image. The first 6 values in the Frame Time Vector will give the time from injection to the first set of scans, the second 6 will contain the time interval for the second set of 6 scans, and so on, for a total of 5 time intervals.</para>
          <para>Another example of an angiographic study with related sets of images is a sequence of SLO/OCT/"ICG filtered" image triples (or SLO/OCT image pairs) that are time-stamped relative to a user-defined event. This user-defined event usually corresponds to the inject time of ICG (indocyanine green) into the patients blood stream. The resultant images form an angiography study where the patient's blood flow can be observed with the "ICG filtered" images and can be correlated with the pathologies observed in the SLO and OCT images that are spatially related to the ICG image with a pixel-to-pixel correspondence on the X-Y plane.</para>

For example, in certain cases the density of cystic formations or the amount of drusen present can be hard to ascertain from a series of unrelated two-dimensional longitudinal images of the eye. However, some OCT machines are capable of taking a sequence of spatially related two-dimensional images in a suitably short period of time. These images can either be oriented longitudinally (perpendicular to the retina) or transversely (near-parallel to the retina). Once such a sequence has been captured, it then becomes possible for the examined volume of data to be reconstructed for an interactive 3D inspection by a user of the system (see <xref linkend="figure_U.3-5" xrefstyle="select: label"/>).

Determining the extent of such cystic formation is much more easily ascertained using transverse images rather than longitudinal images.

    <title>Hanging Protocols (Informative)</title>
    <para>The Hanging Protocol Composite IOD contains information about user viewing preferences, related to image display station (workstation) capabilities. The associated Service Classes support the storage (C-STORE), query (C-FIND) and retrieve (C-MOVE and C-GET) of Hanging Protocol Instances between servers and workstations. The goal is for users to be able to conveniently define their preferred methods of presentation and interaction for different types of viewing circumstances once, and then to automatically layout image sets according to the users' preferences on workstations of similar capability.</para>
    <para>The primary expectation is to facilitate the automatic and consistent hanging of images according to definitions provided by the users, sites or vendors of the workstations by providing the capability to:</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>Allow automatic hanging of image sets to occur for all studies on workstations with sufficiently compatible capabilities by matching against user or site defined Hanging Protocols. This includes supporting automatic hanging when the user reads from different locations, or on different but similar workstation types.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>How relevant image sets (e.g., from the current and prior studies) are obtained is not defined by the Hanging Protocol IOD or Service Classes.</para>
    <para>Conformance with the DICOM Grayscale Standard Display Function and the DICOM Softcopy Presentation States in conjunction with the Hanging Protocol IOD allows the complete picture of what the users see, and how they interact with it, to be defined, stored and reproduced as similarly as possible, independent of workstation type. Further, it is anticipated that implementers will make it easy for users to point to a graphical representation of what they want (such as 4x1 versus 12x1 format with a horizontal alternator scroll mechanism) and select it.</para>
    <section label="V.1" status="2" xml:id="sect_V.1">
      <title>Example Scenario</title>
      <para>User A sits down at workstation X, with two 1024x1280 resolution screens (<xref linkend="figure_V.1-1" xrefstyle="select: label"/>) that recently has been installed and hence has no user specific Hanging Protocols defined. The user brings up the list of studies to be read and selects the first study, a chest CT, together with the relevant prior studies. The workstation queries the Hanging Protocol Query SCP for instances of the Hanging Protocol Storage SOP Class. It finds none for this specific user, but matches a site specific Hanging Protocol Instance, which was set up when the workstation was installed at the site. It applies the site Hanging Protocol Instance, and the user reads the current study in comparison to the prior studies.</para>
      <para>The user decides to customize the viewing style, and uses the viewing application to define what type of Hanging Protocol is preferred (layout style, interaction style) by pointing and clicking on graphical representations of the choices. The user chooses a 3-column by 4-row tiled presentation with a "vertical alternator" interaction, and a default scroll amount of one row of images. The user places the current study on the left screen, and the prior study on the right screen. The user requests the application to save this Hanging Protocol, which causes the new Hanging Protocol Instance to be stored to the Hanging Protocol Storage SCP.</para>
      <para>When the same user comes back the next day to read chest CT studies at workstation X and a study is selected, the application queries the Hanging Protocol Query SCP to determine which Hanging Protocol Instances best match the scenario of this user on this workstation for this study. The best match returned by the SCP in response to the query is with the user ID matching his user ID, the study type matched to the study type(s) of the image set selected for viewing, and the screen types matching the workstation in use.</para>
      <para>A list of matches is produced, with the Hanging Protocol Instance that the user defined yesterday for chest CT matching the best, and the current CT study is automatically displayed on the left screen with that Hanging Protocol. Alternative next best matches are available to the user via the application interface's pull-down menu list of all closely matching Hanging Protocol Instances.</para>
      <para>Because this Hanging Protocol defines an additional image set, the prior year's chest CT study for the same patient is displayed next to the current study, on the right screen.</para>
      <para>The next week, the same user reads chest CTs at a different site in the same enterprise on a similar type workstation, workstation Y, from a different vendor. The workstation has a single 2048x2560 screen (<xref linkend="figure_V.1-1" xrefstyle="select: label"/>). This workstation queries the Hanging Protocol Query SCP, and retrieves matching Hanging Protocol Instances, choosing as the best match the Hanging Protocol Instance used on workstation X before by user A. This Hanging Protocol is automatically applied to display the chest CT study. The current chest CT study is displayed on the left half of the 2048x2560 screen, and the prior chest CT study is displayed on the right half of the screen, with 3 columns and 8 rows each, maintaining the same vertical alternator layout. The sequence of communications between the workstations and the SCP is depicted in <xref linkend="figure_V.1-2" xrefstyle="select: label"/>.</para>

      <title>Hanging Protocol Internal Process Model</title>
      <para>The overall process flow of Hanging Protocols can be seen in <xref linkend="figure_V.2-1" xrefstyle="select: label"/>, and consists of three main steps: selection, processing, and layout. The selection is defined in the 
      <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italic">Hanging Protocol Definition Module</emphasis></emphasis>. The processing and layout are defined in the 
      <emphasis role="italic"><emphasis role="bold">Hanging Protocol Display Module</emphasis>.</emphasis> The first process step, the selection of sets of images that need to be available from DICOM image objects, is defined by the Image Sets Sequence of the 
      <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italic">Hanging Protocol Definition Module</emphasis></emphasis>. This is a N:M mapping, with multiple image sets potentially drawing from the same image objects.</para>
      <para>The second part of the process flow consists of the filtering, reformatting, sorting, and presentation intent operations that map the Image Sets into their final form, the Display Sets. This is defined in the 
      <emphasis role="italic"><emphasis role="bold">Hanging Protocol Display Module</emphasis></emphasis>. This is a 1:M relationship, as multiple Display Sets may draw their images from the same Image Set. The filtering operation allows for selecting a subset of the Image Set and is defined by the Hanging Protocol Display Module Filter Operations Sequence. Reformatting allows operations such as multiplanar reformatting to resample images from a volume (Reformatting Operation Type, Reformatting Thickness, Reformatting Interval, Reformatting Operation Initial View Direction, 3D Rendering Type). The Hanging Protocol Display Module Sorting Operations Sequence allows for ordering of the images. Default presentation intent (a subset of the Presentation State operations such as intensity window default setting) is defined by the Hanging Protocol Display Module presentation intent attributes. The Display Sets are containers holding the final sets of images after all operations have occurred. These sets contain the images ready for rendering to locations on the screen(s).</para>
      <para>The rendering of a Display Set to the screen is determined by the layout information in the Image Boxes Sequence within a Display Sets Sequence Item in the Hanging Protocol Display Module. A Display Set is mapped to a single Image Boxes Sequence. This is generally a single Image Box (rectangular area on screen), but may be an ordered set of image boxes. The mapping to an ordered set of image boxes is a special case to allow the images to flow in an ordered sequence through multiple locations on the screen (e.g., newspaper columns). Display Environment Spatial Position specifies rectangular locations on the screen where the images from the Display Sets will be rendered. The type of interaction to be used is defined by the Image Boxes Sequence Item attributes. A vertically scrolling alternator could be specified by having Image Box Layout Type equal TILED and Image Box Scroll Direction equal VERTICAL.</para>
      <para>An example of this processing is shown in <xref linkend="figure_V.2-2" xrefstyle="select: label"/>. The figure is based on the Neurosurgery Planning Hanging Protocol Example contained in this Annex, and corresponds to the display sets for Display Set Presentation Group #1 (CT only display of current CT study).</para>

      <para>Goal: A Hanging Protocol for MR &amp; CT of Head, for a neurosurgery plan. 1Kx1K screen on left shows orthogonal MPR slices through the acquisition volume, and in one presentation group has a 3D interactive volume rendering in the lower right quadrant. In all display sets the 1Kx1K screen is split into 4 512x512 quadrants. The 2560x2048 screen has a 4 row by 3 column tiled display area. There are 4 temporal presentation groups: CT<subscript>new</subscript>, MR, combined CT<subscript>new</subscript> and MR, combined CT<subscript>new</subscript> and CT<subscript>old</subscript>.</para>
      <para>Display Environment Spatial Position attribute values for image boxes are represented in terms of ratios in pixel space [(0/3072, 512/2560), (512/3072,0/2560)] rather than (0.0,0.0), (1.0,1.0) space, for ease of understanding the example.</para>

    <para>This Annex describes a use of Key Object Selection (KO) and Grayscale Softcopy Presentation State (GSPS) SOP Instances, in conjunction with a typical dictation/transcription process for creating an imaging clinical report. The result is a clinical report as a Basic Text Structured Report (SR) SOP Instance that includes annotated image references (see <xref linkend="sect_X.2" xrefstyle="select: label"/>). This report may also (or alternatively) be encoded as an HL7 Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) document (see <xref linkend="sect_X.3" xrefstyle="select: label"/>).</para>

        <para>During the softcopy reading of an imaging study, the physician dictates the report, which is sent to a transcription service or is processed by a voice recognition system. The transcribed dictation arrives at the report management system (typically a RIS) by some mechanism not specified here.

        <title>Reporting With Image References</title>
        <para>To augment the basic dictation/transcription reporting use case, it is desired to select significant images to be attached (by reference) to the report. During the softcopy reading, the physician may select images from those displayed on his workstation (e.g., by a point-and-click function through the user interface). The selection of images is conveyed to the image repository (PACS) through a DICOM Key Object Selection (KO) document. When the report management system receives the transcribed dictation, it queries the image repository for any KO documents, and appends the image references from the KO to the transcription. In this process step, the report management system does not need to access the referenced images; it only needs to copy the references into the draft report. The correction and signature function potentially allows the physician to retrieve and view the referenced images, correct and change text, and to delete individual image references. See <xref linkend="figure_X.1-2" xrefstyle="select: label"/>.</para>

        <para>Each KO document in this process includes a specific title "For Report Attachment", a single optional descriptive text field, plus a list of image references using the SR Image Content Item format. The report management system may need to retrieve all KO documents of the study to find those with this title, since the image repository might not support the object title as a query return key.</para>
        <para>Multiple KO instances may be created for a study report, e.g., to facilitate associating different descriptive text (included in the KO document) with different images or image sets. All KOs with the title "For Report Attachment" in the study are to be attached to the dictated report by copying their content into the draft report (see <xref linkend="sect_X.2" xrefstyle="select: label"/> and <xref linkend="sect_X.3" xrefstyle="select: label"/>). (There may also be KOs with other titles, such as "For Teaching", that are not to be attached to the report.)</para>

        <para>If the IMAGE content item includes an Icon Image Sequence, the report creation process may embed the icon in the Section.Text narrative. The Icon Image Sequence Pixel Data is converted into an image file, e.g., in JPEG or GIF format, and base64 encoded. The file is encoded in an ObservationMedia entry in the CDA instance, and a &lt;renderMultimedia&gt; tag reference to the entry is encoded in the Section.Text adjacent to the &lt;linkHtml&gt; of the image reference.</para>

        <para>The Current Requested Procedure Evidence Sequence (0040,A375) of the KO instance lists all the SOP Instances referenced in the IMAGE content items in their hierarchical Study/Series/Instance context.

        <title>Using The WADO Reference For DICOM Network Protocol Retrievals</title>
        <para>An application that receives a CDA with image references, and is capable of using the full services of DICOM upper layer protocol directly, can use the WADO parameters in either the linkHtml or in the DGIMG Observation.Text to retrieve the object using the DICOM network services. Such an application would need to be pre-configured with the hostname/IP address, TCP port, and AE Title of the DICOM object server (C-MOVE or C-GET SCP); this network address is not part of the WADO string. (Note that pre-configuration of this network address is typical for DICOM applications, and is facilitated by the LDAP-based DICOM Application Configuration Management Profile; see <olink targetdoc="PS3.15" targetptr="PS3.15" xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/>.)</para>
        <para>The application would open a Query/Retrieve Service Association with the configured server, and send a C-MOVE or C-GET command using the study, series, and object instance UIDs identified in the WADO query parameters. Such an application might also reasonably query the server for related objects, such as Grayscale Softcopy Presentation State.</para>
        <note>
          <para>When using the C-GET service, the retrieving application needs to specify and negotiate the SOP Class of the retrieved objects when it opens the Association. This information is not available in the linkHtml WADO reference; however, it is available in the DGIMG Observation.Code. It may also be obtained from the configured server using a C-FIND query on a prior Association.</para>

        </note>
        <para>There is no requirement that the transform or transcoding between DICOM SR and HL7 CDA be reversible. In particular, some attributes of the DICOM Patient, Study, and Series IEs have no corresponding standard encoding in the HL7 CDA Header, and vice versa. Such data elements, if transcoded, may need to be encoded in "local markup" (in HL7 CDA) or private data elements (in DICOM SR) in an implementation-dependent manner; and some such data elements may not be transcoded at all. It is a responsibility of the transforming application to ensure clinical equivalence.</para>

However, the SR Document may reference the CDA Document as equivalent using the Equivalent CDA Document Sequence (0040,A090) attribute, and the CDA Document may reference the SR Document with a relatedDocument act relationship.</para>
        <para>Since the ParentDocument target of the relatedDocument relationship is constrained to be a simple DOCCLIN act, it is recommended that the reference to the DICOM SR be encoded per <xref linkend="table_X.3-4" xrefstyle="select: label"/>, without explicit identification of the Study and Series Instance UIDs, and with classCode DOCCLIN (rather than DGIMG).</para>

    <title>VOI LUT Functions (Informative)</title>
    <para>Digital projection X-ray images typically have a very high dynamic range due to the digital detector's performance. In order to display these images, various Values Of Interest (VOI) transformations can be applied to the images to facilitate diagnostic interpretation. The original description of the DICOM grayscale pipeline assumed that either the parameters of a linear LUT (window center and width) are used, or a static non-linear LUT is applied (VOI LUT).</para>
    <para>Normally, a display application interprets the window center and width as parameters of a function following a linear law (see <xref linkend="figure_Y-1" xrefstyle="select: label"/>).</para>

    </para>
    <para>A VOI LUT sequence can be provided to describe a non-linear LUT as a table of values, with the limitation that the parameters of this LUT cannot be adjusted subsequently, unless the application provides the ability to scale the output of the LUT (and there is no way in DICOM to save such a change unless a new scaled LUT is built), or to fit a curve to the LUT data, which may then be difficult to parametrize or adjust, or be a poor fit.</para>
    <para>Digital X-ray applications all have their counterpart in conventional film/screen X-ray and a critical requirement for such applications is to have an image "look" close to the film/screen applications. In the film/screen world the image dynamics are mainly driven by the H-D curve of the film that is the plot of the resulting optical density (OD) of the film with respect to the logarithm of the exposure. The typical appearance of an H-D curve is illustrated in <xref linkend="figure_Y-2" xrefstyle="select: label"/>.</para>

    </para>
    <para>In digital applications, a straightforward way to mock up a film-like look would be to use a VOI LUT that has a similar shape to an H-D curve, namely a toe, a linear part and a shoulder instead of a linear ramp.</para>
    <para>While such a curve could be encoded as data within a VOI LUT, DICOM defines an alternative for interpreting the existing window center and width parameters, as the parameters of a non-linear function.</para>
    <para>Figure Y-3 illustrates the shape of a typical sigmoid as well as the graphical interpretation of the two LUT parameters window center and window width. This figure corresponds to the equation definition in <olink targetdoc="PS3.3" targetptr="PS3.3" xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/> for the VOI LUT Function (0028,1056) is SIGMOID.</para>

    <para>If a receiving display application does not support the SIGMOID VOI LUT Function, then it can successfully apply the same window center and window width parameters to a linear ramp and achieve acceptable results, specifically a similar perceived contrast but without the roll-off at the shoulder and toe.</para>
    <para>A receiving display application that does support such a function is then able to allow the user to adjust the window center and window width with a more acceptable resulting appearance.</para>

    <title>Radiation Dose Reporting Use Cases (Informative)</title>
    <section label="AA.1" status="2" xml:id="sect_AA.1">
      <title>Purpose of This Annex</title>
      <para>This Annex describes the use of the X-Ray Radiation Dose SR Object. Multiple systems contributing to patient care during a visit may expose the patient to irradiation during diagnostic and/ or interventional procedures. Each of those equipments may record the dose in an X-Ray Dose Reporting information object. Radiation safety information reporting systems may take advantage of this information and create dose reports for a visit, parts of a procedure performed or accumulation for the patient in total, if information is completely available in a structured content.</para>

      <para>
        <emphasis role="bold">Irradiation Event</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>An irradiation event is the loading of X-Ray equipment caused by a single continuous actuation of the equipment's irradiation switch, from the start of the loading time of the first pulse until the loading time trailing edge of the final pulse. The irradiation event is the "smallest" information entity to be recorded in the realm of Radiation Dose reporting. Individual Irradiation Events are described by a set of accompanying physical parameters that are sufficient to understand the "quality" of irradiation that is being applied. This set of parameters may be different for the various types of equipment that are able to create irradiation events. Any on-off switching of the irradiation source during the event is not treated as separate events, rather the event includes the time between start and stop of irradiation as triggered by the user. E.g., a pulsed fluoro X-Ray acquisition is treated as a single irradiation event.</para>
      <para>Irradiation events include all exposures performed on X-Ray equipment, independent of whether a DICOM Image Object is being created. That is why an irradiation event needs to be described with sufficient attributes to exchange the physical nature of irradiation applied.</para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="bold">Accumulated Dose Values</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>Accumulated Dose Values describe the integrated results of performing multiple irradiation events. The scope of accumulation is typically a study or a performed procedure step. Multiple Radiation Dose objects may be created for one Study or one Radiation Dose object may be created for multiple performed procedures.</para>
    </section>
    <section label="AA.3" status="2" xml:id="sect_AA.3">
      <title>Use Cases</title>
      <para>The following use cases illustrate the information flow between participating roles and the possible capabilities of the equipment that is performing in those roles. Each case will include a use case diagram and denote the integration requirements. The diagrams will denote actors (persons in role or other systems involved in the process of data handling and/or storage). Furthermore, in certain cases it is assumed that the equipment (e.g., Acquisition Modality) is capable of displaying the contents of any dose reports it creates.</para>
      <para>These use cases are only examples of possible uses for the Dose Report, and are by no means exhaustive.</para>
      <section label="AA.3.1" status="3" xml:id="sect_AA.3.1">

        <para>In this use case the user sets up the Acquisition Modality, and performs the study. The Modality captures the irradiation event exposure information, and encodes it together with the accumulated values in a Dose Report. The Modality may allow the user to review the dose report, and to add comments. The acquired images and Dose Report are sent to a Long-Term Storage system (e.g., PACS) that is capable of storing Dose Report objects.</para>
        <para>A Display Station may retrieve the Dose Report from the Storage system, and display it. Because the X-Ray Radiation Dose SR object is a proper subset of the Enhanced SR object, the Display Station may render it using the same functionality as used for displaying any Enhanced SR object.</para>

        <para>The Radiation Safety workstation may also be used to generate more elaborate reports on patient applied dose. The workstation may retrieve the Dose Reports for multiple procedures performed on a particular patient. A report of the cumulative dose for a specified time period, or for a visit/admission, may be generated, encoded as a DICOM Dose Report, and stored in the Long-Term Storage system. Any such further reports will be stored in addition to the "basic report".</para>
        <para>Note that such cumulative Dose Reports may describe irradiation events that are also documented in other Dose Reports. The assignment of a UID to each irradiation event allows the application to identify unique irradiation events that may be reported in multiple objects. The structure of the X-Ray Radiation Dose SR object also allows a cumulative report to reference the contributing report objects using the Predecessor Documents Sequence (0040,A360) attribute.</para>
        <para>An advanced application may be able to use the Dose Report data, potentially supplemented by the data in the image objects referenced in the Dose Report, to create a Dose Map that visualizes applied dose. Such a Dose Map may be sent to the Long-Term Storage system using an appropriate object format.</para>
        <para>Other purposes of the Radiation Safety workstation may include statistical analyses over all Dose Report Objects in order to gain information for educational or quality control purposes. This may include searches for Reports performed in certain time ranges, or with specific equipment, or using certain protocols.</para>

If the SCP has determined that storage commitment has been achieved for all SOP Instances at Node C specified in the original Storage Commitment Request (from Node A), it issues an N-EVENT-REPORT (3) like in the previous examples.

        <para>Node A (an SCU) starts out by transferring the SOP Instances for which committed storage is required to Node B (an SCP) by off-line means on some kind of Storage Media (1). When the data is believed to have arrived at Node B, Node A can issue an N-ACTION to Node B containing a list of references to the SOP Instances contained on the Storage Media, requesting that the SCP perform storage commitment of these SOP Instances (2). If the SCP has determined that all the referenced SOP Instances exist (they may already have been loaded into the system or they may still reside on the Storage Media) and that it has successfully completed storage commitment for the SOP Instances, it issues an N-EVENT-REPORT with the status successful (3) and a list of the stored SOP Instances like in the previous examples.</para>
        <para>If the Storage Media has not yet arrived or if the SCP determines that committed storage can for some other reason not be provided for one or more SOP Instances referenced by the N-ACTION request it would issue an N-EVENT-REPORT with a status of completed - failures exists. With the EVENT-REPORT it would include a list of the SOP Instances that were successfully stored and also a list of the SOP Instances for which storage failed. The SCP is not required to wait for the Storage Media to arrive (however it may chose to wait) but is free to reject the Storage Commitment request immediately. If so, the SCU may decide to reissue another N-ACTION at a later point in time.</para>

    <title>JPIP Referenced Pixel Data Transfer Syntax Negotiation (Informative)</title>
    <para>The JPIP Referenced Pixel Data transfer syntaxes allow transfer of image objects with a reference to a non-DICOM network service that provides the pixel data rather than encoding the pixel data in (7FE0,0010).</para>
    <para>The use cases for this extension to the standard relate to an application's desire to gain access to a portion of DICOM pixel data without the need to wait for reception of all the pixel data. Examples are:</para>
    <orderedlist numeration="arabic">
      <listitem>
        <para>Stack Navigation of a large CT Study.</para>
        <para>In this case, it is desirable to quickly scroll through this large set of data at a lower resolution and once the anatomy of interest is located the full resolution data is presented. Initially lower resolution images are requested from the server for the purpose of stack navigation. Once a specific image is identified the system requests the rest of the detail from the server.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Large Single Image Navigation.</para>
        <para>In cases such as microscopy, very large images may be generated. It is undesirable to wait for the complete pixel data to be loaded when only a small portion of the specific image is of interest. Additionally, this large image may exceed the display capabilities thus resulting in a decimation of the image when displayed. A lower resolution image (i.e., one that matches the resolution of the display) is all that is required, as additional data cannot be fully rendered. Once an area of interest is determined, the application can pan and zoom to this area and request additional detail to fill the screen resolution.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Thumbnails.</para>
        <para>It is desirable to generate thumbnail representations for a study. This has been accomplished through various means, many of which require the client to receive the complete pixel data from the server to generate the thumbnail image. This uses significant network bandwidth.</para>
        <para>The thumbnails can be considered low-resolution representations of the image. The application can request a low-resolution representation of the image for use as a thumbnail.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Display by Dimension.</para>
        <para>Multi-frame images may encode multiple dimensions. It is desirable for an application to access only the specific frames of interest in a particular dimension without the need to receive the complete pixel data set. By using the multi-dimensional description, applications using the JPIP protocol may request frames of the multi-frame image.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>The association negotiation between the initiator and acceptor controls when this method of transfer is used. An acceptor can potentially accept both the JPIP Referenced Pixel Data transfer syntax and a non-JPIP transfer syntax on different presentation contexts. When an acceptor accepts both of these transfer syntaxes, the initiator chooses the presentation context.</para>

    <title>Use of Product Characteristics Attributes in Composite SOP Instances (Informative)</title>
    <para>Bar coding or RFID tagging of contrast agents, drugs, and devices can facilitate the provision of critical information to the imaging modality, such as the active ingredient, concentration, etc. The Product Characteristics Query SOP Class allows a modality to submit the product bar code (or RFID tag) to an SCP to look up the product type, active substance, size/quantity, or other parameters of the product.</para>
    <para>This product information can be included in appropriate attributes of the Contrast/Bolus, Device, or Intervention Modules of the Composite SOP Instances created by the modality. The product information then provides key acquisition context data necessary for the proper interpretation of the SOP Instances.</para>
    <para>This annex provides informative information about mapping from the Product Characteristics Module attributes of the Product Characteristics Query to the attributes of Composite IODs included in several Modules.</para>
    <para>Within this section, if no Product Characteristics Module source for the attribute value is provided, the modality would need to provide local data entry or user selection from a pick list to fill in appropriate values. Some values may need to be calculated based on user-performed dilution of the product at the time of administration.</para>

      <para>The dimensionality of the Vectors Macro (<olink targetdoc="PS3.3" targetptr="sect_C.27.3" xrefstyle="select: docname label"/>) is not restricted to accommodate broader use of this macro in the future. Usage beyond 3-dimensional Euclidean geometry is possible The Vectors Macro may be used to represent any multi-dimensional numerical entity, like a set of parameters that are assigned to a voxel in an image or a primitive in a surface mesh.</para>
      <para>Examples:</para>
      <para>In electroanatomical mapping, one or more tracked catheters are used to sample the electrophysiological parameters of the inner surface of the heart. Using magnetic tracking information, a set of vertices is generated according to the positions the catheter was moved to during the examination. In addition to its 3D spatial position each vertex is loaded with a 7D-Vector containing the time it was measured at, the direction the catheter pointed to, the maximal potential measured in that point, the duration of that potential and the point in time (relative to the heart cycle) the potential was measured.</para>
      <para>For biomechanical simulation the mechanical properties of a vertex or voxel can be represented with a n-dimensional vector.</para>

        <para>A referring physician receives radiological diagnostic reports on CT or MRI examinations. These reports contain references to specific images. He chooses to review these specific images himself and/or show the patient. The references in the report point to particular slices. If the slices are individual images, then they may be obtained individually. If the slices are part of an enhanced multi-frame CT/MR object, then retrieval of the whole multi-frame object might take too long. The Composite Instance Root Retrieve Service allows retrieval of only the selected frames.</para>
        <para>The source of the image and frame references in the report could be KOS, CDA, SR, presentation states or other sources.</para>
        <para>Selective retrieval can also be used to retrieve 2 or more arbitrary frames, as may be used for digital subtraction (masking), and may be used with any multi-frame objects, including multi-frame ultrasound, XR etc.</para>
        <para>Features of interest in many long "video" examinations (e.g., endoscopy) are commonly referenced as times from the start of the examination. The same benefits of reduced WAN bandwidth use could be obtained by shortening the MPEG-2 or JPEG 2000 Part 2 Multi-component based stream prior to transmission.</para>

      <title>Frame Extraction Issues</title>
      <para>There are many different aspects to consider when extracting frames to make a new object, to ensure that the new image remains a fully valid SOP Instance, and the following is a non-exhaustive list of important issues</para>
      <section label="MM.2.1" status="3" xml:id="sect_MM.2.1">
        <title>Number of Frames</title>
        <para>The Number of Frames (0028,0008) attribute will need to be updated.</para>

        <title>Start and End Times</title>
        <para>Any attributes that refer to start and end times such as Acquisition Time (0008,0032) and Content Time (0008,0033) must be updated to reflect the new start time if the first frame is not the same as the original. This is typically the case where the multi-frame object is a "video" and where the first frame is not included. Likewise, Image Trigger Delay (0018,1067) may need to be updated.</para>
      </section>
      <section label="MM.2.3" status="3" xml:id="sect_MM.2.3">
        <title>Time Interval versus Frame Increment Vector</title>
        <para>The Frame Time (0018,1063) may need to be modified if frames in the new image are not a simple contiguous sequence from the original, and if they are irregular, then the Frame Time Vector (0018,1065) will need to be used in its place, with a corresponding change to the Frame Increment Pointer (0028,0009). This also needs careful consideration if non-consecutive frames are requested from an image with non-linearly spaced frames.</para>
      </section>
      <section label="MM.2.4" status="3" xml:id="sect_MM.2.4">
        <title>MPEG-2</title>
        <para>Identifying the location of the requested frames within an MPEG-2 data stream is non-trivial, but if achieved, then little else other than changes to the starting times are likely to be required for MPEG-2 encoded data, as the use-cases for such encoded data (e.g., endoscopy) are unlikely to include explicit frame related data. See the note below however for comments on "single-frame" results.</para>
        <para>An application holding data in MPEG-2 format is unlikely to be able to create a range with a frame increment of greater than one (a calculated frame list with a 3<superscript>rd</superscript> value greater than one), and if such a request is made, it might return a status of AA02: Unable to extract Frames.</para>
        <para>The approximation feature of the Time Range form of request is especially suitable for data held in MPEG-2 form, as it allows the application to find the nearest surrounding key frames, which greatly simplifies editing and improves quality.</para>

        <title>Functional Groups For Enhanced CT, MR, etc.</title>
        <para>It is very important that functional groups for enhanced image objects are properly re-created to reflect the reduced set of frames, as they include important clinical information. The requirement in the standard that the resulting object be a valid SOP instance does make such re-creations mandatory.</para>

        <title>Nuclear Medicine Images</title>
        <para>Images of the Nuclear Medicine SOP class are described by the Frame Increment Pointer (0028,0009), which in turn references a number of different "Vectors" as defined in Table "NM Multi-frame Module" in <olink targetdoc="PS3.3" targetptr="PS3.3" xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/>. Like the Functional Groups above, these Vectors are required to contain one value for each frame in the Image, and so their contents must be modified to match the list of frames extracted, ensuring that the values retained are those corresponding to the extracted frames.</para>

        <title>A "Single Frame" Multi-frame Image</title>
        <para>The requirement that the newly created image object generated in response to a Frame level retrieve request must be the same as the SOP class will frequently result in the need to create a single frame instance of an object that is more commonly a multi-frame object, but this should not cause any problems with the IOD rules, as all such objects may quite legally have Number of Frames = 1.</para>
        <para>However, a single frame may well cause problems for a transfer syntax based on "video" such as those using MPEG-2, and therefore the SCU when negotiating a C-GET should consider this problem, and include one or more transfer syntaxes suitable for holding single or non-contiguous frames where such a retrieval request is being made.</para>

    <section label="MM.3" status="2" xml:id="sect_MM.3">
      <title>Frame Numbers</title>
      <para>Frame numbers are indexes, not identifiers for frames. In every object, the frame numbers always start at 1 and increment by 1, and therefore they will not be the same after extraction into a new SOP Instance.</para>
      <para>A SOP Instance may contain internal references to its own frames such as mask frames. These may need to be corrected.</para>
    </section>
    <section label="MM.4" status="2" xml:id="sect_MM.4">
      <title>Consistency</title>
      <para>There is no requirement in the Frame Level Retrieve Service for the SCP to cache or otherwise retain any of the information it uses to create the new SOP Instance, and therefore, an SCU submitting multiple requests for the same information cannot expect to receive the "same" object with the same Instance and Series UIDs each time. However, an SCP may choose to cache such instances, and if returning an instance identical to one previously created, then the same Instance and Series UIDs may be used. The newly created object is however guaranteed to be a valid SOP instance and an SCU may therefore choose to send such an instance to an SCP using C-STORE, in which case it should be handled exactly as any other Composite Instance of that SOP class.</para>
    </section>
    <section label="MM.5" status="2" xml:id="sect_MM.5">
      <title>Time Synchronization</title>
      <para>The time base for the new composite instance should be the same as for the source image and should use the same time synchronization frame of reference. This allows the object to retain synchronization to any simultaneously acquired waveform data</para>
    </section>
    <section label="MM.6" status="2" xml:id="sect_MM.6">
      <title>Audio</title>
      <para>Where the original object is MPEG-2 with interleaved audio data in the MPEG-2 data stream, and where the retrieved object is also MPEG-2 encoded, then audio could normally be preserved and maintain synchronization, but in other cases, the audio may be lost.</para>

    <section label="MM.7" status="2" xml:id="sect_MM.7">
      <title>Private Attributes</title>
      <para>As with all modifications to existing SOP instances, an application should remove any data that it cannot guarantee to make consistent with the modifications it is making. Therefore, an application creating new images from multi-frame images should remove any private attributes about which it lacks sufficient information to allow safe and consistent modification. This behavior should be documented in the conformance statement.</para>

    <title>Specimen Identification and Management</title>
    <para>This annex explains the use of the Specimen Module for pathology or laboratory specimen imaging.</para>
    <section label="NN.1" status="2" xml:id="sect_NN.1">
      <title>Pathology Workflow</title>
      <para>The concept of a specimen is deeply connected to analysis (lab) workflow, the decisions made during analysis, and the "containers" used within the workflow.</para>
      <para>Typical anatomic pathology cases represent the analysis of (all) tissue and/or non-biologic material (e.g., orthopedic hardware) removed in a single collection procedure (e.g., surgical operation/event, biopsy, scrape, aspiration etc.). A case is usually called an "Accession" and is given a single accession number in the Laboratory Information System.</para>
      <para>During an operation, the surgeon may label and send one or more discrete collections of material (specimens) to pathology for analysis. By sending discrete, labeled collections of tissue in separate containers, the surgeon is requesting that each discrete labeled collection (specimen) be analyzed and reported independently - as a separate "Part" of the overall case. Therefore, each Part is an important, logical component of the laboratory workflow. Within each Accession, each Part is managed separately from the others and is identified uniquely in the workflow and in the Laboratory Information System.</para>
      <para>During the initial gross (or "eyeball") examination of a Part, the pathologist may determine that some or all of the tissue in a Part should be analyzed further (usually through histology). The pathologist will place all or selected sub-samples of the material that makes up the Part into labeled containers (cassettes). After some processing, all the tissue in each cassette is embedded in a paraffin block (or epoxy resin for electron microscopy); at the end of the process, the block is physically attached to the cassette and has the same label. Therefore, each "Block" is an important, logical component of the laboratory workflow, which corresponds to physical material in a container for handling, separating and identifying material managed in the workflow. Within the workflow and Laboratory Information System, each Block is identified uniquely and managed separately from all others.</para>
      <para>From a Block, technicians can slice very thin sections. One or more of these sections is placed on one or more slides. (Note, material from a Part can also be placed directly on a slide bypassing the block). A slide can be stained and then examined by the pathologists. Each "Slide", therefore, is an important, logical component of the laboratory workflow, which corresponds to physical material in a container for handling, separating and identifying material managed in the workflow. Within the workflow and within the Laboratory Information Systems, each Slide is identified uniquely and managed separately from all others.</para>
      <para>While "Parts" to "Blocks" to "Slides" is by far the most common workflow in pathology, it is important to note that there can be numerous variations on this basic theme. In particular, laser capture microdissection and other slide sampling approaches for molecular pathology are in increasing use. Such new workflows require a generic approach in the Standard to identifying and managing specimen identification and processing, not one limited only to "Parts", "Blocks", and "Slides". Therefore, the Standard adopts a generic approach of describing uniquely identified Specimens in Containers.</para>

        <title>Specimen</title>
        <para>A physical object (or a collection of objects) is a specimen when the laboratory considers it a single discrete, uniquely identified unit that is the subject of one or more steps in the laboratory (diagnostic) workflow.</para>
        <para>To say the same thing in a slightly different way: "Specimen" is defined as a <emphasis role="underline">role</emphasis> played by a physical entity (one or more physical objects considered as single unit) when the entity is identified uniquely by the laboratory and is the direct subject of more steps in a laboratory (diagnostic) workflow.</para>
        <para>It is worthwhile to expand on this very basic, high level definition because it contains implications that are important to the development and implementation of the DICOM Specimen Module. In particular:</para>
        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>A single discrete physical object or a collection of several physical objects can act as a single specimen as long as the collection is

        <title>Containers</title>
        <para>Specimen containers (or just "containers") play an important role in laboratory (diagnostic) processes. In most, but not all, process steps, specimens are held in containers, and a container often carries its specimen's ID. Sometimes the container becomes intimately involved with the specimen (e.g., a paraffin block), and in some situations (such as examining tissue under the microscope) the container (the slide and coverslip) become part of the optical path.</para>
        <para>Containers have identifiers that are important in laboratory operations and in some imaging processes (such as whole slide imaging). The DICOM Specimen Module distinguishes the Container ID and the Specimen ID, making them different data elements. In many laboratories where there is one specimen per container, the value of the specimen ID and container ID will be same. However, there are use cases in which there are more than one specimen in a container. In those situations, the value of the container ID and the specimen IDs will be different (see <xref linkend="sect_NN.3.5" xrefstyle="select: label"/>).</para>
        <para>Containers are often made up of components. For example, a "slide" is container that is made up of the glass slide, the cover slip and the "glue" the binds them together. The Module allows each component to be described in detail.</para>

        <para>The Laboratory Information System (LIS) is critical to management of workflow and processes in the pathology lab. It is ultimately the source of the identifiers applied to specimens and containers, and is responsible for recording the processes that were applied to specimens.</para>
        <para>An important purpose of the Specimen Module is to store specimen information necessary to understand and interpret an image <emphasis role="underline">within the image information object</emphasis>, as images may be displayed in contexts where the Laboratory Information System is not available.

        <para>It is expected that the Laboratory Information Systems will participate in the population of the Specimen Module by passing the appropriate information to a DICOM compliant imaging system in the Modality Worklist, or by processing the image objects itself and populating the Specimen Module attributes.</para>
        <para>The nature of the LIS processing for imaging in the workflow will vary by product implementation. For example, an image of a gross specimen may be taken before a gross description is transcribed. A LIS might provide short term storage for images and update the description attributes in the module after a particular event (such as sign out). The DICOM Standard is silent on such implementation issues, and only discusses the attributes defined for the information objects exchanged between systems.</para>

        <title>Laboratory Workflows and Specimen Types</title>
        <para>While created with anatomic pathology in mind, the DICOM Specimen Module is designed to support specimen identification, collection, sampling and processing attributes for a wide range of laboratory workflows. The Module is designed in a general way so not to limit the nature, scope, scale or complexity of laboratory (diagnostic) workflow that may generate DICOM images.</para>
        <para>To provide specificity on the general process, the Module provides extendable lists of Container Types, Container Component Types, Specimen Types, Specimen Collection Types, Specimen Process Types and Staining Types. It is expected that the value sets for these "types" can be specialized to describe a wide range of laboratory procedures.</para>
        <para>In typical anatomic pathology practice, and in Laboratory Information Systems, there are conventionally three identified levels of specimen preparation - part, block, and slide. These terms are actually conflations of the concepts of specimen and container. Not all processing can be described by only these three levels.</para>
        <para>A part is the uniquely identified tissue or material collected from the patient and delivered to the pathology department for examination. Examples of parts would include a lung resection, colon biopsy at 20 cm, colon biopsy at 30 cm, peripheral blood sample, cervical cells obtained via scraping or brush, etc. A part can be delivered in a wide range of containers, usually labeled with the patients name, medical record number, and a short description of the specimen such as "colon biopsy at 20 cm". At accession, the lab creates a part identifier and writes it on the container. The container therefore conveys the part's identifier in the lab.</para>
        <para>A block is a uniquely identified container, typically a cassette, containing one or more pieces of tissue dissected from the part (tissue dice). The tissue pieces may be considered, by some laboratories, as separate specimens. However in most labs, all the tissue pieces in a block are considered a single specimen.</para>
        <para>A slide is a uniquely identified container, typically a glass microscope slide, containing tissue or other material. Common slide preparations include:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>

        <title>Relationship Between Specimens and Containers</title>
        <para>Virtually all specimens in a clinical laboratory are associated with a container, and specimens and containers are both important in imaging (see "Definitions", above). In most clinical laboratory situations there is a one to one relationship between specimens and containers. In fact, pathologists and LIS systems routinely consider a specimen and its container as single entity; e.g., the slide (a container) and the tissue sections (the specimen) are considered a single unit.</para>
        <para>However, there are legitimate use cases in which a laboratory may place two or more specimens in the same container (see <xref linkend="sect_NN.4" xrefstyle="select: label"/> for examples). Therefore, the DICOM Specimen Module distinguishes between a Specimen ID and a Container ID. However, in situations where there is only one specimen per container, the value of the Specimen ID and Container ID may be the same (as assigned by the LIS).</para>
        <para>Some Laboratory Information System may, in fact, not support multiple specimens in a container, i.e., they manage only a single identifier used for the combination of specimen and container. This is not contrary to the DICOM Standard; images produced under such a system will simply always assert that there is only one specimen in each container. However, a pathology image display application that shows images from a variety of sources must be able to distinguish between container and specimen IDs, and handle the 1:N relationship.</para>
        <para>In allowing for one container to have multiple specimens, the Specimen Module asserts that it is the Container, not the Specimen, that is the unique target of the image. In other words, one Container ID is required in the Specimen Module, and multiple Specimen IDs are allowed in the Specimen Sequence.

This is the most complex part of the module.</para>

      <title>Examples of Specimen Module Use</title>
      <para>This section includes examples of the use of the Specimen Module. Each example has two tables.</para>
      <para>The first table contains the majority of the container and specimen elements of the Specimen Module. The second includes the Specimen Preparation Sequence (which documents the sampling, processing and staining steps).</para>
      <para>In the first table, invocations of Macros have been expanded to their constituent attributes. The Table does not include Type 3 (optional) attributes that are not used for the example case.</para>
      <para>The second table shows the Items of the Specimen Preparation Sequence and its subsidiary Specimen Preparation Step Content Item Sequence. That latter sequence itself has subsidiary Code Sequence Items, but these are shown in the canonical DICOM "triplet" format (see <olink targetdoc="PS3.16" targetptr="PS3.16" xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/>), e.g., (T-28600, SRT, "Left Upper Lobe of Lung"). In the table, inclusions of subsidiary templates have been expanded to their constituent Content Items. The Table does not include Type U (optional) Content Items that are not used for the example case.</para>
      <para>Values in the colored columns of the two tables actually appear in the image object.</para>

        <para>This is an example of how the Specimen Module can be populated for a gross specimen (a lung lobe resection received from surgery). The associated image would be a gross image taken in gross room.</para>

      <title>Specimen Data in Pathology Imaging Workflow Management</title>
      <para>Workflow management in the DICOM imaging environment utilizes the Modality Worklist (MWL) and Modality Performed Procedure Step (MPPS) services. Within the pathology department, these services support both human controlled imaging (e.g., gross specimen photography), as well as automated slide scanning modalities.</para>
      <para>While this section provides an overview of the DICOM services for managing workflow, the reader is referred to the IHE Anatomic Pathology Domain Technical Framework for specific use cases and profiles for pathology imaging workflow management.</para>

        <title>Modality Worklist</title>
        <para>The contents of the Specimen Module may be conveyed in the Scheduled Specimen Sequence of the Modality Worklist query. This feature allows an imaging system (Modality Worklist SCU) to query for work items by Container ID. The worklist server (SCP) of the laboratory information system can then return all the necessary information for creating a DICOM specimen-related image. This information includes patient identity and the complete slide processing history (including stain applied). It may be used for imaging set-up and/or inclusion in the Image SOP Instance.</para>

          <title>MWL for Whole Slide Imaging</title>
          <para>In addition to the Specimen Module attributes, the set up of an automated whole slide scanner requires the acquisition parameters such as scan resolution, number of Z-planes, fluorescence wavelengths, etc. A managed set of such parameters is called a Protocol (see <olink targetdoc="PS3.3" targetptr="PS3.3" xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/>), and the MWL response may contain a Protocol Code to control scanning set up. Additional set-up parameters can be passed as Content Items in the associated Protocol Context Sequence; this might be important when the reading pathologist requests a rescan of the slide with slightly different settings.</para>

        <para>Intra-oral radiography typically involves acquisition of multiple images of various parts of the dentition. Many digital radiographic systems offer customized templates that are used for displaying the images in a study on the screen. These templates may also be referred to as mounts or view sets. The Structured Display Object represents a standard method of encoding and exchanging the layout and intended display of Structured Displays. A structured display object created in this manner could be stored with a study and exchanged with images to allow for complete reproduction of the original exam.</para>

        <title>3D Volume Data sets</title>
        <para>The 3D volume data set is conveyed via the Enhanced US Volume SOP Class, which represents individual 3D Volume Data sets or collections of temporally-related 3D Volume Data sets using the 'enhanced' multi-frame features used by Enhanced Storage SOP Classes for other modalities, including shared and per-frame functional group sequences and multi-frame dimensions. The 3D Volume Data sets represented by the Enhanced Ultrasound IOD (the striped box in <xref linkend="figure_PP.3-1" xrefstyle="select: label"/>) are suitable for Multi-Planar Reconstruction (MPR) and 3D rendering operations. Note that the generation of the Cartesian volume, its relationship to spatially-related 2D frames (whether the volume was created from spatially-related frames, or spatially-related frames extracted from the Cartesian volume), and the algorithms used for MPR or 3D rendering operations are outside the scope of this standard.</para>
        <para>Functional Group Macros allow the storage of many parameters describing the acquisition and positioning of the image planes relative to the patient and external frame of references (such as a gantry or probe locating device). These macros may apply to the entire instance (Shared Functional Group) or may vary frame-to-frame (Per-Frame Functional Group).</para>
        <para>Multi-frame Dimensions are used to organize the data type, spatial, and temporal variations among frames. Of particular interest is Data Type used as a dimension to relate frames of different data types (like tissue and flow) comprising each plane of an ultrasound image (item 1c in the use case hierarchy). Refer to <olink targetdoc="PS3.3" targetptr="sect_C.8.24.3.3" xrefstyle="select: label"/> for the use of Dimensions with the Enhanced US Volume SOP Class.</para>
        <para>Sets of temporally-related volumes may have been acquired sequentially or acquired asynchronously and reassembled into a temporal sequence, such as through Spatial-Temporal Image Correlation (STIC). Regardless of how the temporal volume sequence was acquired, frames in the resultant volumes are marked with a temporal position value, such as Temporal Position Time Offset (0020,930D) indicating the temporal position of the resultant volumes independent of the time sequence of the acquisition prior to reassembly into volumes.</para>

        <title>2D Derived Images</title>
        <para>The 2D image types represent collections of frames that are related to or derived from the volume data set, namely Render Views (projections), separate Multi-Planar Reconstruction (MPR) views, or sets of spatially-related source frames, either parallel or oblique (the cross-hatched images in <xref linkend="figure_PP.3-1" xrefstyle="select: label"/>). The Ultrasound Image and Ultrasound Multi-frame Image IODs are used to represent these related or derived 2D images. The US Image Module for the Ultrasound Image Storage and Ultrasound Multi-frame Image Storage SOP Classes have defined terms for "3D Rendering" (render or MPR views) and "Spatially Related Frames" in value 4 of the Image Type (0008,0008) attribute to specify that the object contains these views while maintaining backwards compatibility with Ultrasound review applications for frame-by-frame display, which may be displayed sequentially ("fly-through" or temporal) loop display or as a side-by-side ("light-box") display of spatially-related slices. Also, the
        optional Source Image Sequence (0008,2112) and Derivation Code Sequence (0008,9215) attributes may be included to more succinctly specify the type of image contained in the instance and the 3D Volume Data set from which it was derived.</para>
        <para>2D Derived image instances should be linked to the source 3D Volume Data set through established DICOM reference mechanisms. This is necessary to support the "Two-Stage Review" use case. Consider the following examples:</para>

        <title>Workflow Considerations</title>
        <para>The use case of two-step review (item 2a in the use case hierarchy) is addressed by the use of separate SOP Classes for 2D and 3D data representations. A review may initially be performed on the Ultrasound Image and Ultrasound Multi-frame image instances created during the study. If additional operations on the 3D volume data set are desired, the Enhanced US Volume instance referenced in the Source Image Sequence of the derived object may be individually retrieved and operated upon by an appropriate application.</para>
        <para>The 3D volume data set spatially relates individual frames of the image to each other using the Transducer Frame of Reference defined in <olink targetdoc="PS3.3" targetptr="sect_C.8.24.2" xrefstyle="select: docname label"/> (items 2b in the use case hierarchy). This permits alignment of frames with each other in the common situation where a hand-held ultrasound transducer is used without an external frame of reference. However, the Transducer Frame of Reference may in turn be related to an external Frame of Reference through the Transducer Gantry Position and Transducer Gantry Orientation attributes. This would permit the creation of optional Image Position and Orientation values relative to the Patient when this information is available. In addition to these frames of reference, the spatial registration, fiducials, segmentation, and deformation objects available for other Enhanced objects may also be used with the Enhanced US Volume instances.</para>
        <para>The Key Object Selection Document SOP Class may be used to identify specific Enhanced US Volume instances of particular interest (item 2d in the use case hierarchy).</para>

        <note>
          <para>Compared to Example 1, the perceived contrast of the displayed grayscale image will likely be different as a consequence of the use of PCS-Values as opposed to P-Values unless color management software interpreting the PCS-Values attempts to approximate the Grayscale Standard Display Function. This is true regardless of whether a color or grayscale display is used.</para>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <para>Refractive instruments are the most commonly used instruments in eye care. At present many of them have the capability for digital output, but their data is most often addressed by manual input into a paper or electronic record.</para>
      <para>Refractive instruments address the power of a lens or of a patient's eye to bend light. In order for a patient to see well light must be focused on the retina in the back of the eye. If the natural optics of a patient's eye do not accomplish this, corrective lenses can bend incident light so that it will be focused on the retina after passing through the optics of the eye. The power of an optical system such as a spectacle lens or the eye is measured by its ability to bend light, and is measured in diopters (D). In practical clinical applications, this is measured to 3 decimal points, in increments of 0.125 D. The power of a lens is measured in at least two major meridians. A spherical lens power occurs when the power is the same in all meridians (0-180 degrees). A cylindrical lens power occurs when there is a difference in lens power across the various meridians. The shape of the anterior surface of the eye largely determines what type of correcting lens is needed. An eye
      that requires only spherical lens power is usually shaped spherically, more like a ball, while an eye that requires cylindrical lens power is ellipsoid and shaped more like a football.</para>
      <para>Lenses can also bend light without changing its focal distance. This type of refraction simply displaces the position of the image laterally. The power of a prism to bend light is measured in prism diopters. In practical clinical applications this is measured to 1 decimal point, in increments of 0.5 prism diopters. Prism power is required in a pair of spectacles most commonly when both eyes are not properly aligned with the object of regard. Clinical prisms are considered to bend all light coming in from the lens either up, down, in toward the nose, or out away from the nose, in order to compensate for ocular misalignment.</para>
      <para>Visual acuity is measured in various 
      <emphasis role="italic">scales</emphasis>, all of which indicate a patient's vision as a fraction of what a reference standard patient would see at any given distance. For example, if a patient has 20/30 vision it means that he sees from a distance of 20 feet what a reference standard patient would see from a distance of 30 feet. These measurements are determined by presentation of standardized objects or symbols (optotypes) of varying sizes calibrated to reference standard vision (20/20). The smallest discernible optotype defines the patient's visual acuity expressed in a variety of formats (letters, numbers, pictures, tumbling E, Landolt C, etc).</para>
      <para>Visual acuity is measured in two categories of 
      <emphasis role="italic">viewing distances</emphasis>: distance, and near. Distance visual acuity is measured at 20' or six meters. This distance is roughly equivalent to optical infinity for clinical purposes. The near viewing distance can vary from 30cm to 75 cm depending on a variety of other conditions, but most commonly is measured at 40 cm.</para>
      <para>Visual acuity is measured under several common 
      <emphasis role="italic">viewing conditions</emphasis>: 1) Uncorrected vision is measured using the autoprojector to project the above mentioned optotypes for viewing, with no lenses in front of the patient's eyes. The line of smallest optotypes of which the patient can see more than half is determined, and that information is uploaded to a computer system. 2) The patient's vision using habitual correction is measured in a similar fashion using whichever vision correction the patient customarily wears. 3) Pinhole vision is measured in a similar fashion, with the patient viewing the optotypes through a pinhole occluder held in front of the eye. Pinhole visual acuity testing reduces retinal blur, providing an approximation of what the patient's vision should be with the best possible refractive correction (spectacles) in place. 4) Best corrected visual acuity is the visual acuity with the best refractive correction in place. 5) Crowding visual acuity measures the presence and
      amount of disparity in acuity between single optotype and multiple optotype presentations.</para>
      <para>A patient's spectacle prescription may or may not represent the same lenses that provided best corrected visual acuity in his refraction. Subjective comfort plays a role in determining the final spectacle prescription.</para>

          <para>Autolensometer: an autolensometer is used to measure the refractive power of a patient's spectacles. This is done by the automatic analysis of the effect of the measured lens upon a beam of light passing through it. Output from an autolensometer can be uploaded to a phoropter to provide a baseline for subjective refraction (discussed below), and it can be uploaded to a computerized medical record. Lenses may also be measured to confirm manufacturing accuracy.</para>

The patient looks through the phoropter lenses at an eye chart that may be at 20 ft or 6m or at a reading chart that may be at 40 cm. Information from the subjective refraction can be uploaded from an autophoropter to a computer. The best corrected vision that was obtained is displayed in an autoprojector, and that information can also be uploaded to a computer.</para>

          <para>Autokeratometer: an autokeratometer is used to measure the curvature, and thus the refractive power, of a patient's cornea. Two measurements are generally taken, one at the steepest and one at the flattest meridian of the cornea. The meridian measured is expressed in degrees, whole integers, in increments of 1 degree. If the measurement is expressed as power, the unit of measurement is diopters, to 3 decimal points, in increments of 0.125D. If the measurement is expressed as radius of curvature, the unit of measurement is millimeters, to 2 decimal points, in increments of 0.01 mm.</para>

        <title>Background</title>
        <para>Visual acuity is defined as the reciprocal of the ratio between the letter size that can just be recognized by a patient, relative to the size just recognized by a <emphasis role="italic">standard eye</emphasis>. If the patient requires letters that are twice as large (or twice as close), the visual acuity is said to be 1/2; if the letters need to be 5x larger, visual acuity is 1/5, and so on.</para>
        <para>Note that the scales in the tables extend well above the reference standard (1.0, 20/20, the ability to recognize a letter subtending a visual angle 5 min. of arc), since normal acuity is often 1.25 (20/16), 1.6 (20/12.5) or even 2.0 (20/10).</para>
        <para>Today, the ETDRS chart and ETDRS protocol, established by the National Eye Institute in the US, are considered to represent the <foreignphrase xml:lang="la">de facto</foreignphrase> gold standard for visual acuity measurements The International Council Of Ophthalmology, Visual Standard, Aspects and Ranges of Vision Loss (April, 2002) is a good reference document.</para>
        <para>The full ETDRS protocol requires a wide chart, in the shape of an inverted triangle, on a light box, and cannot be implemented on the limited screen of a projector (or similar) chart.</para>
        <para>For most routine clinical measurements projector charts or traditional charts with a rectangular shape are used; these non-standardized tools are less accurate than ETDRS measurements.</para>
        <para>This appendix contains two lookup tables, one for traditional charts and one for ETDRS measurements.</para>

        <title>Notations</title>
        <para>Various notations may be used to express visual acuity. Snellen (in 1862) used a fractional notation in which the numerator indicated the actual viewing distance; this notation has long been abandoned for the use of equivalent notations, where the numerator is standardized to a fixed value, regardless of the true viewing distance. In Europe the use of decimal fractions is common (1/2 = 0.5, 1/5 = 0.2); in the US the numerator is standardized at 20 (1/2 = 20/40, 1/5 = 20/100), while in Britain the numerator 6 is common (1/2 = 6/12, 1/5 = 6/30).</para>
        <para>The linear scales on the right side of the tables are not meant for clinical records. They are required for statistical manipulations, such as calculation of differences, trends and averages and preferred for graphical presentations. They convert the logarithmic progression of visual acuity values to a linear one, based on Weber-Fechner's law, which states that proportional stimulus increases lead to linear increases in perception.</para>
        <para>The logMAR scale is calculated as log (MAR) = log (1/V) = - log (V). LogMAR notation is widely used in scientific publications. Note that it is a scale of vision loss, since higher values indicate poorer vision. The value "0" indicates "no loss", that is visual acuity equal to the reference standard (1.0, 20/20). Normal visual acuity (which is better than 1.0 (20/20) ) is represented by negative logMAR values.</para>
        <para>The VAS scale (VAS = Visual Acuity Score) serves the same purpose. Its formula is: 100 - 50 x logMAR or 100 + 50 x log (V). It is more user friendly, since it avoids decimal values and is more intuitive, since higher values indicate better vision. The score is easily calculated on ETDRS charts, where 1 point is credited for each letter read correctly. The VAS scale also forms the basis for the calculation of visual impairment ratings in the AMA <emphasis role="italic">Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment.</emphasis></para>

        <title>Use of The Lookup Table</title>
        <para>Data input: Determine the notation used in the device and the values of the lines presented. No device will display all the values listed in each of the traditional columns. Convert these values to the decimal DICOM storage values shown on the left of the same row. DICOM values are not meant for data display. In the table, they are listed in scientific notation to avoid confusion with display notations.</para>
        <para>In the unlikely event that a value must be stored that does not appear in the lookup table, calculate the decimal equivalent and round to the nearest listed storage value.</para>
        <para>Data display: If the display notation is the same as the input notation, convert the DICOM storage values back to the original values. If the notation chosen for the display is different from the input notation, choose the value on the same row from a different column. In certain cases this may result in an unfamiliar notation; unfortunately, this is unavoidable, given the differences in size progressions between different charts. If a suffix (see attribute "Visual Acuity Modifiers" (0046,0135) ) is present, that suffix will be displayed as it was recorded.</para>
        <para>Suffixes: Suffixes may be used to indicate steps that are smaller than a 1 line difference. On traditional charts, such suffixes have no defined numerical value. Suffixes +1, +2, +3 and -1, -2, -3 may be encountered. These suffixes do not correspond to a defined number of rows in the table.</para>

        <title>Traditional Charts</title>
        <para>The Traditional charts used in clinical practice are not standardized; they have an irregular progression of letter sizes and a variable number of characters per line. Measurement accuracy may further suffer from hidden errors that cannot be captured by any recording device, such as an inconsistent, non-standardized protocol, inaccurate viewing distance, inaccurate projector adjustment and contrast loss from room illumination. Therefore, the difference between two routine clinical measurements should not be considered significant, unless it exceeds 5 rows in the table (1 line on an ETDRS chart).</para>
        <para><xref linkend="table_RR-1" xrefstyle="select: label"/> contains many blank lines to make the vertical scale consistent with that used in <xref linkend="table_RR-2" xrefstyle="select: label"/>. Notations within the same gray band are interchangeable for routine clinical use, since their differences are small compared to the clinical variability, which is typically in the order of 5 rows (1 ETDRS line).</para>

        <title>ETDRS Charts</title>
        <para>ETDRS charts feature Sloan letters with proportional spacing, 5 letters on each line, and a logarithmic progression of letter sizes with consistent increments of approximately 25% per line (10 lines equal a factor 10x). The ETDRS protocol specifies letter-by-letter scoring, viewing distance, illumination, use of different charts for right and left eye and other presentation parameters.</para>
        <para>The full ETDRS protocol requires a wide chart on a light box, and cannot be implemented on the limited screen of a projector (or similar) chart. The logarithmic progression, however, can be implemented on any device. This progression was first proposed by John Green in 1868 and follows the standard "Preferred Numbers, ISO standard 3 (1973) " series and the rounding preferences.</para>
        <para>Use of ETDRS charts allows use of letter-by-letter scoring, which is more accurate than the line-by-line scoring used on traditional charts. Each row in the table is equivalent to 1 letter on an ETDRS chart (50 letters for a factor 10x). These steps are smaller than the just discernible difference; steps this small only become significant in statistical studies where a large number of measurements is averaged.</para>
        <para>The smaller steps for letter by letter scoring may be expressed in two ways; either by using suffixes to a familiar (sometimes slightly rounded) set of values or by using calculated values. For clinical use suffixes have the advantage of using only familiar acuity notations and reverting to the nearest clinical notation when the suffix is omitted. Calculated values look less familiar; but are sometimes used in statistical studies. Note that suffixes used in the context of an ETDRS chart have a defined value and affect the DICOM storage value, whereas suffixes used in the context of traditional charts do not.</para>

All relationships defined in the Colon CAD SR IOD templates are by-value. Content items referenced from another SR object instance, such as a prior Colon CAD SR, are inserted by-value in the new SR object instance, with appropriate original source observation context.

      <para>The CAD Processing and Findings Summary section of the SR Document Content tree of a Colon CAD SR IOD may contain a mixture of current and prior single image findings and composite features.

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <para>Ophthalmologists use OPT data to diagnose and characterize tissues and abnormalities in transverse and axial locations within the eye. For example, an ophthalmologist might request an OPT of the macula, the optic nerve or the cornea in either or both eyes for a given patient. Serial reports can be compared to monitor disease progression and response to treatment. OPT devices produce two categories of clinical data: B-scan images and tissue measurements.</para>
    </section>
    <section label="UU.2" status="2" xml:id="sect_UU.2">
      <title>Use of B-scan Images</title>
      <para>Prior to interpreting an OPT B-scan (or set of B-scans), users must first determine if the study is of adequate quality to answer the diagnostic question. Examples of inadequate studies include:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The pathology that needs to be visualized does not appear within the field of the scan.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>The image quality is not sufficient to see the tissue layers of interest (i.e., media opacity, blink, etc).</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>The scans are not in the expected anatomic order (i.e., due to eye movements).</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>In some cases, inadequate images can be corrected by capturing another scan in the same area. However, in other cases, the patient's eye disease interferes with visualization of the tissues of interest making adequate image quality impossible. Ideally, when choosing between multiple scans of the same tissue area, physicians would have access to information about the above questions so they can select only the best scan(s).</para>
      <para>The physician may then choose to view and assess each B-scan in the data set individually. When assessing OPT B-scans, ophthalmologists often identify normal or expected tissue boundaries first, then proceed to identify abnormal interfaces or structures next. The identification of pathology is both qualitative (i.e., does a structure exist) and quantitative (i.e., how thick is it). If previous scans are present for this patient, the physician may choose to compare the most recent scan data with prior visits. Due to workflow constraints, it may be difficult for B-scan interpretations to happen on the same machine that captures the images. Therefore, remote image assessment, such as image viewing in the examining room with the patient, is optimal.</para>
    </section>
    <section label="UU.3" status="2" xml:id="sect_UU.3">
      <title>Use of Tissue Measurements</title>
      <para>In addition to viewing B-scan image data, clinicians also use quantitative measurements of tissue thicknesses or volumes extracted automatically from the OPT images. As with image quality, the accuracy of automated segmentation must be assessed prior to use of the numerical measurements based on these boundaries. This is typically accomplished by visual inspection of boundary lines placed on the OPT images but also can be inferred from analysis confidence measurements provided by the device software. In addition to segmentation accuracy, it is also important to determine if the region of interest has been aligned appropriately with the intended sampling area of the OPT.</para>
      <para>The analysis software application segments OPT images using the raw data of the instrument to quantify tissue optical reflectivity and location in longitudinal scan or B-scan images. Many boundaries can be identified automatically with software algorithms, see <xref linkend="figure_UU.3-1" xrefstyle="select: label"/>.</para>

      <para>The innermost (anterior) layer of the retina, the internal limiting membrane (ILM) is often intensely hyperreflective and defines the innermost border of the nerve fiber layer. The nerve fiber layer (NFL) is bounded posteriorly by the ganglion cell layer and is not visible within the central foveal area. In high quality OPT scans, the sublamina of the inner plexiform layer may be identifiable. The external limiting membrane is the subtle interface between the outer nuclear layer and the photoreceptors. The junction between the photoreceptor inner segments and outer segments (IS/OS junction) is often intensely hyperreflective and in time domain OPT systems, was thought to represent the outermost boundary of the retina. Current thought, however, suggests that the photoreceptors extend up to the next bright interface, often referred to as the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) interdigitation. This interface may be more than 35 micrometers beyond the IS/OS junction. When three
      high intensity lines are not present under the retina, however, this interdigitation area may not be visible. The next bright region typically represents the RPE cell bodies, which consist of a single layer of cuboidal cells with reflective melanosomes oriented at the innermost portion of the cells. Below the RPE cells is a structure called Bruch's membrane, which is contiguous with the outer RPE cell membrane.</para>
      <para>The axial thickness and volume of tissue layers can be measured using the boundaries defined above. For example, the nerve fiber layer is typically measured from the innermost ILM interface to the interface of the NFL with the retina. Time domain OPT systems measure retinal thickness as the axial distance between the innermost ILM interface and the IS/OS junction. However, high resolution OPT systems now offer the potential to measure true retinal thickness (ILM to outermost photoreceptor interface) in addition to variants that include tissue and fluid that may intervene between the retina and the RPE. The RPE layer is measured from the innermost portion of the RPE cells, which is the hyper reflective melanin-containing layer to the outermost highly reflective interface. Pathologic structures that may intervene between normal tissue layers may obscure their appearance but often can be measured using the same methods as normal anatomic layers.</para>

      <para>The macular grid is based upon the grid employed by the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) to measure area and proximity of macular edema to the anatomic center of the macula, also called the fovea. This grid was developed as an overlay for use with 32mm film color transparencies and fluorescein angiograms in the seminal trials of laser photocoagulation for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy. Subsequently, this grid has been in common use at reading centers since the 1970s, has been incorporated into ophthalmic camera digital software, and has been employed in grading other macular disease in addition to diabetic retinopathy. This grid was slightly modified for use in Time Domain OPT models developed in the 1990s and early 2000s in that the dimensions of the grid were sized to accommodate a 6 mm diameter sampling area of the macula.</para>
      <para>The grid for macular OPT is bounded by circular area with a diameter of 6 mm. The center point of the grid is the center of the circle. The grid is divided into 9 standard subfields. The center subfield is a circle with a diameter of 1 mm. The grid is divided into 4 inner and 4 outer subfields by a circle concentric to the center with a diameter of 3 mm. The inner and outer subfields are each divided by 4 radial lines extending from the center circle to the outermost circle, at 45, 135, 225, and 315 degrees, transecting the 3 mm circle in four places. Each of the 4 inner and 4 outer subfields is labeled by its orientation with regard to position relative to the center of the macula - superior, nasal, inferior, and temporal. For instance, the superior inner subfield is the region bounded by the center circle and the 3 mm circle the 315 degree radial line, and the 45 degree radial line. The nasal subfields are those oriented toward the midline of the patient's face, nearest
      to the optic nerve head. The grids for the left and right eyes are reversed with respect to the positions of the nasal and temporal subfields - in viewing the grid for the left eye along the antero-posterior (Z) axis, the nasal subfields are on the left side and in the right eye the nasal subfields are on the right side (nasal as determined by the location of the subfield closest to the nose).</para>
      <para>The OPT macula thickness report consists of the thickness at the center point of the grid, and the mean retinal thickness calculated for each of the 9 subfields of the grid. In the context of the macular disease considered for the diagnosis, and qualitative interpretation of morphology from examination and OPT and/or other modalities, the clinician uses the macula thickness report to determine if the center and the grid subfield averages fall outside the normative range. Monitoring of macular disease by serial grid measurements allows assessment of disease progression and response to intervention. Serial measurements are assessed by comparing OPT thickness or volume reports, provided that the grids are appropriately centered upon the same location in the macula for each visit.</para>

        <para>The center point of the grid should be aligned with the anatomic center of the macula, the fovea. This can be approximated by having the patient fixate upon a target coincident with the center of the grid. However, erroneous retinal thickness measurements are obtained when the center of the grid is not aligned with the center of the macula. This may occur in patients with low vision that cannot fixate upon the target, or in patients that blink or move fixation during the study. To determine the expected accuracy of inter-visit comparisons, clinicians would benefit from knowing the alignment accuracy of the OPT data from the two visits. Ophthalmologists may also want to customize locations on the fundus to be monitored at each visit.</para>

      <title>Interpretation of OPT</title>
      <para>The process of evaluation of diabetic macular edema will help illustrate the role of the OPT macula thickness report. In diabetic macular edema there is a breakdown in the blood retina barrier, which can lead to focal and/or diffuse edema (or thickening) of the macula. The report of the thickness of each subfield area of the macula grid will help direct treatment. For instance, laser treatment to a specific thickened quadrant would be expected to reduce the thickness of retina in the treated zone. Serial comparisons of OPT thicknesses should demonstrate a reduction in thickness in the successfully treated zone. A zone that subsequently became thicker on follow-up scans may warrant further treatment. In addition to an expected local response to specific zonal treatment such as laser, there are treatments with drugs and biologics that are less localized. For instance, the injection of intravitreal drugs in a successfully treated eye would be expected to have a global
      reduction of thickness in all zones with DME. Patients with severe retinal disease may lose the ability to fixate making the acquisition of OPT images to represent a specific zone less reliable.</para>

      <title>Workflow Example</title>
      <para>The following is an example of audit trail message use in a hypothetical workflow. It is not intended to be all-inclusive, nor does it cover all possible scenarios for audit trail message use. There are many alternatives that can be utilized by the system designer, or that could be configured by the local site security administrator to fit security policies.</para>
      <para>As this example scenario begins, an imaging workstation boots up. During its start up process, a DICOM-enabled viewing application is launched by the start up sequence. This triggers an Application Activity message with the Event Type Code of (110120, DCM, "Application Start").</para>
      <para>After start up, a curious, but unauthorized visitor attempts to utilize the reviewing application. Since the reviewing application cannot verify the identity of this visitor, the attempt fails, and the reviewing application generates a User Authentication message, recording the fact that this visitor attempted to enter the application, but failed.</para>
      <para>Later, an authorized user accesses the reviewing application. Upon successfully identifying the user, the reviewing application generates a User Authentication message indicating a successful login to the application.</para>
      <para>The user, in order to locate the data of a particular examination, issues a query, which the reviewing application directs to a DICOM archive. The details of this query are recorded by the archive application in a Query message.</para>
      <para>The reviewing application, in delivering the results of the query to the user, displays certain patient related information. The reviewing application records this fact by sending a Patient Record message that is defined by some other standard. Audit logs will contain messages specified by a variety of different standards. The MSG-ID field is used to aid the recognition of the defining standard or proprietary source documentation for a particular message.</para>
      <para>From the query results, the user selects a set of images to review. The reviewing application requests the images from the archive, and records this fact in a Begin Transferring Instances message.</para>
      <para>The archive application locates the images, sends them back to the reviewing application, and records this fact in an Instances Transferred message.</para>
      <para>The reviewing application displays the images to the user, recording this fact via an Instances Accessed message.</para>
      <para>During the reviewing process, the use looks up details of the procedure from the hospital information system. The reviewing application performs this lookup using HL7 messaging, and records this fact in a Procedure Record message.</para>
      <para>The user decides that a follow-up examination is needed, and generates a new order via HL7 messaging to the hospital information system. The reviewing application records this in an Order Record message.</para>
      <para>The user decides that a second opinion is desirable, and selects certain images to send to a colleague in an e-mail message. The reviewing application records the fact that it packaged and sent images via e-mail in an Export message.</para>

    <title>Use Cases for Application Hosting</title>
    <section label="XX.1" status="2" xml:id="sect_XX.1">
      <title>Agent-Specific Post Processing</title>
      <para>Many metabolic/contrast agents require more than just simple imaging to provide data for decision making. Rather than just detecting the presence or absence of the metabolic/contrast agents, calculations based on relative uptake rates, or decay rates, comparisons with previous or neighboring data, fusion of data from multiple sources or time points, etc. may be necessary to properly evaluate image data with these metabolic/contrast agents. Often the nature of this processing is closely related to the type of agent, the anatomy, and the disease process being targeted. The processing may be so specific that the general-purpose image processing features found on medical imaging workstations are inadequate to properly perform the procedure. The effective use of a particular agent for a particular procedure may depend on having properly tuned, targeted post-processing. Both the algorithms used, as well as the workflow in performing the analysis, may be customized for performing
      procedures with a particular agent.</para>
      <para>The stakeholders interested in developing such agent- and exam-specific post-processing applications may have a vested interest in insuring that such post-processing applications can run on a wide variety of systems. The standard post-processing software API outlined in <olink targetdoc="PS3.19" targetptr="PS3.19" xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/> could simplify the distribution of such agent-specific analysis applications. Rather than creating multiple versions of the same application, each version targeted to a particular medical imaging vendor's system, the application developer need only create a single version of the application, which would run on any system that implemented the standard API.</para>
      <para>Differences in physical characteristics, acquisition technique and equipment, and user preference affect image quality and processing requirements. By allowing the sharing of applications based on device-independent (or conversely, device-specific) procedures, the Hosted Application technology will reduce these differences to a minimum.</para>

    <section label="XX.2" status="2" xml:id="sect_XX.2">
      <title>Support For Multi-site Collaborative Research</title>
      <para>A common API for Application Hosting facilitates multi-site research.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Site-specific problems</emphasis>: The development of molecular imaging applications can be accelerated with multiple site cooperation in the validation of new algorithms and software. However, the run-time environment and tools available at one site typically are not matched identically at other sites, hampering the sharing of applications between sites. Using the same tools allows them to share applications. One cannot simply take an application written at one of these sites, and make it run on the other site without major software work involving the installation and configuration of multiple tool packages. Even after installing the needed tools and libraries, software developed at one site may be trying to access facilities that are unavailable at the other site, for example, facilities to store, access, and organize the image data. Often the data formats applications from one site are expecting are incompatible with the data formats available at other
      sites. Having a standard API could help minimize these data incompatibilities.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Gap between research and clinical environments</emphasis>: The initial versions of agent-specific applications are typically created in a research environment, and are not easily accessible in the clinical environment. The early experimental work generally is done by exporting the image data out of the clinical environment to research workstations, and then importing the results back into the clinical system once the analysis is done. While exporting and importing the images may be sufficient for the early research work, clinical acceptance of an application can be significant enhanced if that application could run in the same clinical environment where the images are collected, in order to better fit into the clinical workflow.</para>
      <para>The problem of mismatched run time environments becomes even more acute when attempting to run the typical research application on a production clinical workstation. Due to a variety of legal and commercial concerns, vendors of the systems utilized in the clinical environment generally do not support running unknown software, nor do most commercial vendors have the time or resources to assist the hundreds of researchers who may wish to port a particular application to that vendor's system. Even if researchers manage to load an experimental program onto a clinical system, the experimental program rarely has direct access to the data stored on that clinical system, nor can it directly store results back into the system's clinical database. Without a single standard interface, users have to resort to the cumbersome and time-consuming export and input routines to be able to run research programs on clinical data. It is expected that the constrained environment that a standard
      API provides would be simpler to validate, particularly if it is universally deployed by multiple vendors, and could lessen the burden on any individual system vendor.</para>

    <section label="XX.3" status="2" xml:id="sect_XX.3">
      <title>Screening Applications</title>
      <para>Computer Aided Diagnosis and Decision Making (CAD) is becoming more prevalent in radiology departments. Many classes of exams now routinely go through a computer screening process prior to reading. One potential barrier to more widespread use of CAD screening is that the various vendors of CAD applications typically only allow their applications to run on servers or workstations provided by those companies. A clinical site that wishes to utilize, for example, mammo CAD from one vendor and lung CAD from another often is forced to acquire two different servers or workstations from the two different vendors.</para>
      <para>The Hosted Application concept described in <olink targetdoc="PS3.19" targetptr="PS3.19" xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/> could be used to facilitate the running of multiple CAD applications from multiple vendors on the same computer system.</para>
    </section>
    <section label="XX.4" status="2" xml:id="sect_XX.4">
      <title>Modality-Specific Post Processing</title>
      <para>As medical imaging technology progresses, new modalities are added to the standard. For example, vessel wall detection in intravascular ultrasound is often easier if the images are left in radial form. Unfortunately, most DICOM workstations would not know how to deal with images in such a strange format even though the workstation might recognize that it is an image.</para>
      <para>One possible solution is for a workstation to seek out an appropriate Hosted Application for handling Modalities or SOP classes that it does not recognize. This would allow for automatic handling of all image types by a generic imaging platform. Similarly, SOP Classes, even private SOP Classes, could be created that depend on particular Hosted Applications to prepare data for display.</para>

    <section label="XX.5" status="2" xml:id="sect_XX.5">
      <title>Measurement/Evidence Document Creation</title>
      <para>Another natural use for such a standardized API is the creation of exam-specific analysis and measurement programs for the creation of Evidence Documents (Structured Reports). The standardized API would allow the same analysis program to run on a variety of host systems, reducing the amount of development needed to support multiple platforms.</para>

    <section label="XX.6" status="2" xml:id="sect_XX.6">
      <title>CAD Rendering</title>
      <para>Often the regulatory approval for CAD systems includes the method by which the CAD marks are presented to the user. Providers of CAD systems have used dedicated workstations for such display in the past in order to insure that the CAD marks are presented as intended. If there were a suitable standardized API for launching hosted applications, a Hosted Application could handle the display of CAD results on any workstation that supports that standardized API.</para>

      <title>An Example of Distance Line Defined As A Combined Graphic Object</title>
      <para>Now, a distance line is defined as a combined graphic object, i.e., grouping a text object with a polyline graphic object (see <xref linkend="figure_YY-2" xrefstyle="select: label"/>). Distance lines are typically used for measurements and for computing the grayscale values along this line to build up a profile curve.</para>
      <para>This simple example is intended to show how the Graphic Group ID (0070,0295) is used for grouping of graphic annotations.</para>

        <title>Mating Features</title>
        <para>These Attributes establish a Cartesian coordinate system relative to the Frame of Reference of the implant. When two implants are assembled using a pair of mating features, a rigid spatial registration can be established, that transforms one Frame of Reference so that the mating features align. The figure below gives a simple example in 2D how two implants (symbolized by two rectangles) are matched according to a mating feature pair. For each 2D and 3D template present, a set of coordinates is assigned to each Mating Feature Sequence Item.</para>

        <para>It is recommended to give Mating Features that are somehow related, the same Mating Feature ID (0068,63F0) in different implant templates. This may help applications to switch between components while keeping connections to other components.

        <para>Instances of the Implant Assembly Template IOD are utilized to define intended combinations of implant templates. An Implant Assembly Template consists of a sequence of component type definitions (Component Type Sequence (0076,0032)) that references Implant Template Instances and assigns roles to the referenced implants. In the example in <xref linkend="figure_ZZ.1-4" xrefstyle="select: label"/>, the component types "Stems" and "Heads" are defined. Four different stems and two different heads are referenced. Both groups are flagged mandatory and exclusive, i.e., a valid assembly requires exactly one representative of each group.</para>
        <para>The Component Assembly Sequence (0076,0060) declares possible connections between components referenced by the component groups. Each sequence item refers to exactly two implant templates that are part of at least one component group in the same Implant Assembly Template Instance.

      <title>Planning Landmarks</title>
      <para>Registration of implant templates with patient images according to anatomical landmarks is one of the major features of implantation planning. For that purpose, geometric features can be attached to Implant Template Instances. Three kinds of landmarks are defined: Points, lines, and planes. Each landmark consists of its geometric definition, which is defined per template, and a description.</para>
      <para>When registering an Implant Template to a patient data set like an Image or a Surface Segmentation, the planning software should establish a spatial transformation that matches to planning landmarks to corresponding geometric features in the patient data set.</para>

      <title>Implant Registration and Mating Example</title>
      <para>In this section, an example is presented that shows the usage of Implant Templates together with an Implant Assembly Template to create an Implantation Plan with patient images. The example is in 2D but can easily be extended to 3D as well. The example looks at a simplified case of hip reconstruction planning, using a monoblock stem component and a monoblock cup component.</para>
      <para>Planning consists of 2 steps: Selection and placement of the best fitting cup from the cups referenced by the Assembly Template based on the dimension of the patient's hip is the first step. With that done, a stem is selected that can be mated with the selected cup and has a neck configuration that leads to an optimal outcome with regard to leg length and other parameters. Therefore, the available stems are placed so that the features align. The femoral planning landmarks are used to calculate the displacement of the femur this configuration would result in. The workflow is shown in the following set of figures.</para>

        <para>The hip joint has several degrees of freedom, of course. The Implant Template should contain this information in the Mating Features. In the given 2D projections, the rotational freedom of the joint is expressed by one single rotation around the axis of projection intersecting with the printing space at the 2D coordinate of the Mating Feature. Therefore, a Degree Of Freedom Sequence Item added to either the stem, the cup, or both.</para>
        <para>In planning, this information could be used to visualize the rotational capacities of the joint after implantation.</para>
        <note>
          <para>Technically, the degree of freedom could also have been added to the cup or even (each with half the range of freedom) to both. But since we are used to seeing the femur's rotation with respect to the pelvis and not the other way around, it seemed natural to do it that way.</para>

      <para>Different versions of Implant Templates reflect the changes a manufacturer is doing on the Implant Templates he issues. The Implant Templates that are issued by a manufacturer (or a third party who is acting on behalf of the manufacturer) are always ORIGINAL. Software vendors, PACS integrators, or other stakeholders will add information to such templates for different purposes. The Instances that are generated by this process is called derivation and the resulting instances are labeled DERIVED. Implantation Plans, i.e., electronic documents describing the result of implantation planning, are specified in an instance of the Implantation Plan SR Document. There, the implants that are relevant for one plan are included by reference. When such plans are exchanged between systems or organizations it is likely that the receiving party has access to other versions of templates as the sending party has. In order to maintain readability of exchanged plans, the following is
      required:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>All necessary information about an implant that is relevant to display and understand a plan is present in the ORIGINAL Implant Templates that were issued by a manufacturer. This is assured by these Attributes being Type 1 in the IOD.</para>

          <para>Derived Instances contain the information about the source Instances they were derived from. All Instances contain a reference to the ORIGINAL Instance they were derived from. If an application receives a plan that references an implant it does not have in its database, it will find the UID of the ORIGINAL Instance in the plan, too. It can query its database for an instance that was derived from that Instance and thereby find an Instance it can use to present the plan.</para>

    <title>Implantation Plan SR Document (Informative)</title>
    <para>For the implantation of bone mounted implants, information that has been generated during the implantation planning phase is needed in the OR. To convey this information to the OR, this supplement to the DICOM standard introduces the DICOM format for the results of an implantation planning activity referring to implant templates. An Implantation Plan SR Document should be utilized by surgeons, navigation devices, and for documentation purposes. The Plan contains relevant intraoperative information concerning the assembly of the implant components, resection lines, registration information, and relevant patient data. Thus, the Implantation Plan SR Document can help to enhance information logistics within the workflow. It does not contain any information about the planned surgical workflow. This information may be addressed by other DICOM Supplements. Nevertheless, this SR document may reference to or may be referenced by objects containing workflow information.</para>
    <para>Additionally, once an implantation plan has been generated, it can be used as input for a planning application to facilitate adaption of a plan in cases where this is necessary due to unforeseen situations.</para>
    <para>The workflow is considered to be the following:</para>
    <para>Some kind of planning application helps the user to perform implantation planning; he can choose the optimal implant for a patient using implant templates from a repository. The user aligns the implant template with patient data with or without the help of the application. (Planning without patient data can be stored in the Implantation Plan SR Document as well.)</para>
    <para>Subsequently, an Implantation Plan SR Document Instance will be created that contains the results of the planning. No information of the process itself (previously chosen implant templates, methods, etc.) will be stored. However, an Implantation Plan Document is considered to contain the important parameters to retrace a planning result.</para>
    <para>There are two main components an Implantation Plan SR Document consists of (see <xref linkend="figure_AAA.1-1" xrefstyle="select: label"/>). The implant component selection is used to point to a selected implant template in the repository, whereas the assembly is used to describe the composition of the selected implant templates. <xref linkend="figure_AAA.2-1" xrefstyle="select: label"/> shows how the Implantation Plan SR Document parts make references to the implant templates. Each Implantation Plan SR Document can contain a single implant component selection and several assemblies but it describes only one planning result for one particular patient.</para>
    <para>The recipient of the Implantation Plan SR Document can decide whether to read only the "list" of used implants or to go into detail and read the compositions as well. In both cases, he must have access to the repository of the Implant Templates to get detailed information about the implant (such as its geometry).</para>

      <title>Implantation Plan SR Document Dental Drilling Template Example</title>
      <para>The following example shows the result of a planning activity for a dental implantation using a dental drilling template. The implant positioning is based on a CT-Scan during which the patient has been wearing a bite plate with 3 markers. In this example the markers (visible in the patient's CT images) are detected by the planning application. After the implants have been positioned, the bite plate, in combination with the registration information of the implants, can be used to produce the dental drilling template.</para>
      <para>In the following example, two implants are inserted that are not assembled using Mating Points.</para>
      <para>The markers of the bite plate are identified and stored as 3 Fiducials in one Fiducial Set. This Fiducial Set has its own Frame of Reference (1.2.3.4.100).</para>
      <para>The Registration Object created by the planning application uses the patient's CT Frame of Reference as main Frame of Reference (see <xref linkend="figure_AAA.4-1" xrefstyle="select: label"/>).</para>

    <title>Unified Procedure Step in Radiotherapy (Informative)</title>
    <section label="BBB.1" status="2" xml:id="sect_BBB.1">
      <title>Purpose of this Annex</title>
      <para>This annex provides examples of message sequencing when using the Unified Procedure Step SOP Classes in a radiotherapy context. This section is not intended to provide an exhaustive set of use cases but rather an informative example. There are other valid message sequences that could be used to obtain an equivalent outcome and there are other valid combinations of actors that could be involved in the workflow management.</para>
      <para>The current use cases assume that tasks are always scheduled by the scheduler prior to being performed. It does not address the use case of an emergency or otherwise unscheduled treatment, where the procedure step will be created by a different device. However, Unified Procedure Step does provide a convenient mechanism for doing this.</para>
      <para>The use cases addressed in this annex are:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Treatment Delivery Normal Flow - Treatment Delivery System (TDS) performs the treatment delivery that was scheduled by the Treatment Management System (TMS). Both the "internal verification" and "external verification" flavors are modeled in these use cases.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Treatment Delivery - Override or Additional Information Required. Operating in the external verification mode, the Machine Parameter Verifier (MPV) detects an out-of-tolerance parameter of missing information, and requests the user to override the parameter or supply or correct the missing information. This use case addresses the situation where the 'verify' function is split from the TDS, but does not address verification of a subset of parameters by an external delivery accessory such as a patient positioner.</para>

          <title>Message Sequencing</title>
          <para><xref linkend="figure_BBB.3.1.1-1" xrefstyle="select: label"/> illustrates a message sequence example in the case where a treatment procedure delivery is requested and performed by a delivery device that has internal verification capability. In the example, no 'setup verification' is performed, i.e., the patient is assumed to be in the treatment position. Unified Procedure Step (UPS) is used to request delivery of a session of radiation therapy (commonly known as a "fraction") from a specialized Application Entity (a "Treatment Delivery System"). That entity performs the requested delivery, completing normally. Further examples could be constructed for discontinued, emergency (unscheduled) and interrupted treatment delivery use cases, but are not considered in this informative section (see DICOM Part 17 for generic examples).</para>
          <para>In this example the Treatment Delivery System conforms to the UPS Pull SOP Class as an SCU, and the Treatment Management System conforms to the UPS Pull SOP Class as an SCP. In alternative implementations requiring on-the-fly scheduling and notification, other UPS SOP classes could be implemented.</para>

              <para>Query UPS.</para>
              <para>The TDS queries the TMS for Unified Procedure Steps (UPSs) matching its search criteria. For example, all worklist items with a Unified Procedure Step Status of "SCHEDULED", and Input Readiness State (0040,4041) of "READY". This is conveyed using the C-FIND request primitive of the UPS Pull SOP Class.</para>

              <para>The TDS receives the set of Unified Procedure Steps (UPSs) resulting from the Query UPS message. The Receive UPS is conveyed via one or more C-FIND response primitives of the UPS Pull SOP Class. Each response (with status pending) contains the requested attributes of a single Unified Procedure Step (UPS).</para>
              <para>The TMS returns a list of one or more UPSs based on its own knowledge of the planned tasks for the querying device. Two real-world scenarios are common in this step:</para>
              <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                  <para>There is no TMS Console located in the treatment area, and selection of the delivery to be performed has not been made. In this case, the TMS returns a list of potentially many UPSs (for different patients), and the User picks from the list the UPS that they wish to deliver.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                  <para>The User has direct access to the TMS in the treatment area, and has already selected the delivery to be performed on the console of the TMS, located in the treatment room area. In this case, a single UPS is returned. The TDS may either display the single item for confirmation, or proceed directly to loading the patient details.</para>

              <para>A returned set of UPSs may have more than one UPS addressing a given treatment delivery. For example, in the case where a patient position verification is required prior to delivery, there might be a UPS with Requested Procedure Code Sequence item having a Code Value of 121708 ("RT Patient Position Acquisition, CT MV"), another UPS with a Code Value of 121714 ("RT Patient Position Registration, 3D CT general"), another UPS with a Code Value of 121722 ("RT Patient Position Adjustment"),and a fourth UPS whose Requested Procedure Code Sequence item would have a Code Value of 121726 ("RT Treatment With Internal Verification").</para>

            <listitem>
              <para>'Select Procedure' on TDS console</para>
              <para>The User selects one of the scheduled procedures specified on the TDS console. If exactly one UPS was returned from the UPS query described above, then this step can be omitted.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
              <para>Get UPS Details and Retrieve Archive Objects</para>
              <para>The TDS may request the details of one or more procedure steps. This is conveyed using the N-GET primitive of the UPS Pull SOP Class, and is required when not all necessary information can be obtained from the query response alone.</para>
              <para>The TDS then retrieves the required SOP Classes from the Input Information Sequence of the returned UPS query response. In response to a C-MOVE Request on those objects (5a), the Archive then transmits to the TDS the SOP Instances to be used as input information during the task. These SOP Instances might include an RT Plan SOP Instance, and verification images (CT Image or RT Image). They might also include RT Beams Treatment Record SOP Instances if the Archive is used to store these SOP Instances rather than the TMS. The TDS knows of the existence and whereabouts of these SOP Instances by virtue of the fully-specified locations in the N-GET response.</para>
              <para>Although the TDS could set the UPS to 'IN PROGRESS' prior to retrieving the archive instances, this example shows the archive instances being retrieved prior to the UPS being 'locked' with the N-ACTION step. This avoids the UPS being set 'IN PROGRESS' if the required instances are not available, and therefore avoids the need to schedule another (different) procedure step in this case, as required by the Unified Procedure Step State Diagram State Diagram (<olink targetdoc="PS3.4" targetptr="PS3.4" xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/>). However, some object instances dynamically created to service performing of the UPS step should be supplied after setting the UPS 'IN PROGRESS' (see Step 7).</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
              <para>Change UPS State to IN PROGRESS</para>
              <para>The TDS sets the UPS (which is managed by the TMS) to have the Unified Procedure Step Status of 'IN PROGRESS' upon starting work on the item. The SOP Instance UID of the UPS will normally have been obtained in the worklist item. This is conveyed using the N-ACTION primitive of the UPS Pull SOP Class with an action type "UPS Status Change". This message allows the TMS to update its worklist and permits other Performing Devices to detect that the UPS is already being worked on.</para>
              <para>The UPS is updated in this step before the required dynamic SOP Instances are obtained from the TMS (see Step 7). In radiation therapy, it is desirable to signal as early as possible that a patient is about to undergo treatment, to allow the TMS to begin other activities related to the patient delivery. If the TMS implements the UPS Watch SOP Class, other systems will be able to subscribe for notifications regarding the progress of the procedure step.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
              <para>Retrieve TMS Objects</para>
              <para>In response to a C-MOVE Request, the TMS transmits to the TDS the RT Beams Delivery Instruction and possibly RT Treatment Summary Record SOP Instances to be used as input information during the task. These SOP Instances may be created "on-the-fly" by the TMS (since it was the TMS itself that transmitted the UIDs in the UPS). The RT Treatment Summary SOP Instance may be required by the TDS to determine the delivery context, although the UPS does specify a completion delivery (following a previous delivery interruption). RT Beams Treatment Record instances might also be retrieved from the TMS in this step if the TMS is used to manage these SOP Instances rather than the Archive.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
              <para>'Start Treatment Session' on TDS console</para>

              <para>The TDS then performs internal verifications to determine that the machine is ready to deliver the radiation, and then delivers the therapeutic radiation for the specified beam. In the current use case, it is assumed that the radiation completes normally, delivering the entire scheduled fraction.

              <para>Store Results</para>
              <para>The TDS stores any generated results to the Archive. This would typically be achieved using the Storage and/or Storage Commitment Service Classes and may contain one or more RT Beams Treatment Records or RT Treatment Summary Records, RT Images (portal verification images), CT Images (3D verification images), RT Dose (reconstructed or measured data), or other relevant Composite SOP Instances. References to the results and their storage locations are associated with the UPS in the Set UPS to Final State message (below). The RT Beams Treatment Record instances might be stored to the TMS instead, if the TMS is used to manage these SOP Instances rather than the Archive.</para>
              <para>The required SOP Instances are stored to the Archive in this step before the UPS is status is set to COMPLETED. In radiation therapy, it is desirable to ensure that the entire procedure is complete, including storage of important patient data, before indicating that the step completed successfully. For some systems, such as those using Storage Commitment, this may not be possible, in which case another service such as Instance Availability Notification (not shown here) would have to be used to notify the TMS of SOP Instance availability. For the purpose of this example, it is assumed that the storage commitment response occurs in a short time frame.</para>

          <para><xref linkend="figure_BBB.3.2.1-1" xrefstyle="select: label"/> illustrates a message sequence example in the case where a treatment procedure delivery is requested and performed by a conventional delivery device requiring an 
          <emphasis role="underline">external</emphasis> verification capability.</para>
          <para>In the case where external verification is requested (i.e., where the UPS Requested Procedure Code Sequence item has a value of "RT Treatment With External Verification"), the information contained in the UPS and potentially other required delivery data must be communicated to the Machine Parameter Verifier (MPV). In many real-world situations the Oncology Information System fulfills both the role of the TMS and the MPV, hence this communication is internal to the device and not standardized. If separate physical devices perform the two roles, the communication may also be non-standard, since these two devices must be very closely coupled.</para>
          <para>Elements in bold indicate the additional messages required when the Machine Parameter Verifier is charged with validating the beam parameters for each beam, prior to radiation being administered. These checks can be initiated by the User on a beam-by-beam basis ('manual sequencing', shown with the optional 'Deliver Beam x' messages), or can be performed by the Machine Parameter Verifier without intervention ('automatic sequencing'). The TDS would typically store an RT Treatment Record SOP Instance after each beam.</para>
          <para>This example illustrates the case where photon or electron beams are being delivered. If ion beams are to be delivered, instances of the RT Conventional Machine Verification IOD will be replaced with instances of the RT Ion Machine Verification IOD.</para>
          <para>Delivery of individual beams can be explicitly requested by the User (as shown in this example), or sequenced automatically by the TDS.</para>

          <para>7a. Communicate UPS and Required Delivery Data to MPV</para>
          <para>The MPV must receive information about the procedure to be performed, and any other data required in order to carry out its role. This communication typically occurs outside the DICOM standard, since the TMS and MPV are tightly coupled (and may be the same physical device). In cases where standardized network communication of these parameters is required, this could be achieved using DICOM storage of RT Plan and RT Delivery Instruction SOP Instances, or alternatively by use of the UPS Push SOP Class.</para>
          <para>After the User has initiated the treatment session on the TDS console (Step 8), the following steps are then performed:</para>

          <para>After the TDS has signaled the UPS current Referenced Beam Number and completion percentage for a given beam (9), the following sequence of steps is performed:</para>
          <para>9a. Set 'Beam x' RT Conventional Machine Verification Instance</para>
          <para>The TDS sets the RT Conventional Machine Verification SOP Instance to transfer the necessary verification parameters. This is conveyed using the N-SET primitive of the RT Conventional Machine Verification SOP Class. The Referenced Beam Number (300C,0006) attribute is used to specify the beam to be delivered. It is the responsibility of the SCU to keep track of the verification parameters such that the complete list of required attributes can be specified within the top-level sequence items.</para>
          <para>9b. Initiate Verification</para>
          <para>The TDS sets the RT Conventional Machine Verification SOP Instance to indicate that the TDS is ready for external verification to occur. This is conveyed using the N-ACTION primitive of the RT Conventional Machine Verification SOP Class.</para>
          <para>9c. Verify Machine Parameters</para>
          <para>The MPV then attempts to verify the treatment parameters for 'Beam x'. The MPV sends one or more N-EVENT-REPORT signals to the TDS during the verification process. The permissible event types for these signals in this context are 'Pending' (zero or more times, not shown in this use case), and 'Done' when the verification is complete (successful or otherwise).</para>
          <para>9d. Get RT Conventional Machine Verification (optional step)</para>
          <para>The TDS may then request attributes of the RT Conventional Machine Verification instance. This is conveyed using the N-GET primitive of the RT Conventional Machine Verification SOP Class. If verification has occurred normally and the N-EVENT-REPORT contained a Treatment Verification Status of VERIFIED (this use case), then this step is not necessary unless the TDS wishes to record additional parameters associated with the verification process.</para>
          <para>The TDS then delivers the therapeutic radiation. In the current use case, it is assumed that the radiation completes normally, delivering the entire scheduled fraction. Other use cases, such as voluntary interruption by the User, or interruption by the TDS or MPV, are not described here. If the delivery requires an override of additional information, a different message flow occurs. This is illustrated in the use case described in the next section.</para>
          <para>9e. Store 'Beam x' RT Beams Treatment Record to Archive</para>
          <para>The TDS stores an RT Beams Treatment Record to the Archive (or potentially the TMS as described in <xref linkend="sect_BBB.3.1.2" xrefstyle="select: label"/> Transactions and Message Flow). The RT Beams Treatment Record is therefore not stored in Step 11 for the external verification case (since it has already been stored in the step on a per-beam basis).</para>
          <para>For each subsequent beam in the sequence of beams being delivered, steps 8a (optional), 9, 9a, 9b, 9c, 9d (optional), and 9e are then repeated, i.e., N-SET, N-ACTION, and N-GET operations are performed on the same instance of the RT Conventional Machine Verification SOP Class, which persists throughout the beam session.</para>
          <para>9f. Delete RT Conventional Machine Verification Instance</para>
          <para>When all beams have been processed, the TDS deletes the RT Conventional Machine Verification SOP Instance to indicate to the MPV that verification is no longer required. This is conveyed using the N-DELETE primitive of the RT Conventional Machine Verification SOP Class.</para>

      <title>Axial Measurements</title>
      <para>An axial measurements device is used to take axial measurements of the eye, from the anterior surface of the cornea to either the surface of the retina (ultrasound) or the retinal photoreceptors (optical). The axial measurements are typically expressed in mm (Ophthalmic Axial Length (0022,1010). Currently these measurements are taken using ultrasound or laser light. The measurements are used in calculation of intraocular lens power for cataract surgery. Axial measurements devices and software on other systems perform intraocular lens power calculations using the axial measurements in addition to measurements from other sources (currently by manual data entry, although importation from other software systems is expected in the future).</para>
      <para>When the natural lens of the eye turns opaque it is called a cataract. The cataract is surgically removed, and a synthetic intraocular lens is placed where the natural lens was before. The power of the lens that is placed determines what the patient's refractive error will be, meaning what power his glasses will need to be to maximize vision after surgery.</para>
      <para>Axial measurements devices provide graphical displays that help clinicians to determine whether or not the probe used in taking the measurements is aligned properly. Annotations on the display provide information such as location of gates that assists the clinician in assessing measurement quality. High, fairly even waveform spikes suggest that the measurement producing a given graph is likely to be reliable. The quality of the graphical display is one of the factors that a clinician considers when choosing which axial length measurement to use in calculating the correct intraocular lens power for a given patient.</para>

      <title>Intraocular Lens Calculations Introduction</title>
      <para>Axial measurements devices and software on other systems perform intraocular lens power calculations for cataract surgery patients. The power selection of intraocular lens to place in a patient's eye determines the refractive correction (e.g., glasses, contact lenses, etc.) the patient will require after cataract surgery.</para>
      <para>The data input for these calculations consists of ophthalmic axial length measurements (one dimensional ultrasound scans that are called "A-scans" in the eye care domain) and keratometry (corneal curvature) measurements in addition to constants and sometimes others kinds of measurements. The data may come from measurements performed by the device, on which the intraocular lens calculation software resides, or from manual data entry, or from an external source. There are a number of different formulas and constants available for doing these calculations. The selection of formula to use is based on clinician preference and on patient factors such as the axial length of the eye. The most commonly used constants, encoded by Concept Name Code Sequence (0040,A043) using <olink targetdoc="PS3.16" targetptr="sect_CID_4237" xrefstyle="select: labelnumber quotedtitle"/>, are a function of the model of intraocular lens to be used.</para>
      <para>The most commonly used formulas, encoded by IOL Formula Code Sequence (0022,1029) using <olink targetdoc="PS3.16" targetptr="sect_CID_4236" xrefstyle="select: labelnumber quotedtitle"/>, for intraocular lens calculation are inaccurate in a patient who has had refractive surgery, and numerous other formulas are available for these patients. Since most of them have not been validated to date, they were not included in this document.</para>
      <para>Intraocular lens calculation software typically provides tabular displays of intraocular lens power in association with each lens's predicted refractive error (e.g., glasses, contact lenses, etc).</para>

Arrows at the bottom of the waveform indicate the location of gates, which may be manually adjusted to limit the range
      of accepted values. Note that in the lower right corner of the display two measurements are recorded. In the column labeled AXL is an axial length measurement, which on this device is the sum of the measurements for ACD (anterior chamber depth), lens, and VCD (vitreous chamber depth). The measured time value for each of the segments and a presumed velocity of sound for that segment are used to calculate the axial length for that segment. An average value for each column is displayed below along with the standard deviation of measurements in that column. The average axial length is the axial length value selected by this machine, although often a clinician will make an alternative selection.</para>

      <para>Physical distance is on the x axis, and signal strength is on the y axis. What is actually measured is phase shift, determined by looking at interference patterns of coherent light. Physical distance is calculated by dividing "optical path length" by the "refractive group index" - using an assumed average refractive group index for the entire eye. The "optical path length" is derived from the phase shift that is actually observed. Similar to ultrasound, this waveform allows clinicians to judge the quality of an axial length measurement.</para>

The corneal spike is suppressed (outside the frame on the left hand side) and represents the reference 0 mm. The single spike on this display represents the signal from the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and provides the axial length measurement value (position of the circle marker). Sometimes smaller spikes can be observed on the left or right side of the RPE peak. Those spikes represent reflections from the internal limiting membrane (ILM,150-350 µm before RPE) or from the choroid (150-250 µm behind RPE) respectively.</para>

      <para>Automated visual fields are the most commonly used method to assess the function of the visual system. This is accomplished by sequentially presenting visual stimuli to the patient and then requiring the patient press a button if he/she perceives a stimulus. The stimuli are presented at a variety of points within the area expected to be visible to the patient and each of those points is tested with multiple stimuli of varying intensity. The result of this is a spatial map indicating how well the patient can see throughout his/her visual field.</para>

        <title>Evaluation For Glaucoma</title>
        <para>The diagnosis and management of Glaucoma, a disease of the optic nerve, is the primary use of visual field testing. In this regard, automated visual fields are used to assess quantitatively the function of the optic nerve with the intent of detecting defects caused by glaucoma.</para>
        <para>The first step in analyzing a visual field report is to confirm that it came from the correct patient. Demographic information including the patient's name, gender, date of birth, and perhaps medical record number are therefore essential data to collect. The patient's age is also important in the analysis of the visual field (see below) as optic nerve function changes with age. Finally, it is important to document the patient's refractive error as this needs to be corrected properly for the test to be valid.</para>
        <para>Second, the clinician needs to assess the reliability of the test. This can be determined in a number of ways. One of these is by monitoring patient fixation during the test. To be meaningful, a visual field test assumes that the subject was looking at a fixed point throughout the test and was responding to stimuli in the periphery. Currently available techniques for monitoring this fixation include blind spot mapping, pupil tracking, and observation by the technician conducting the test. Blind spot mapping starts by identifying the small region of the visual field corresponding to the optic nerve head. Since the patient cannot detect stimuli in this area, any positive response to a stimulus placed there later in the test indicates that the patient has lost fixation and the blind spot has "moved". Both pupil tracking and direct observation by the technician are now easily carried out using a camera focused on the patient's eye.</para>
        <para>
          <figure label="DDD.2-3" pgwide="1" xml:id="figure_DDD.2-3">

          </figure>
        </para>
        <para>Another means of assessing the reliability of the test is to count both false positive and false negative responses. False positives occur when the subject presses the button either in response to no stimulus or in response to a stimulus with intensity significantly below one they had not detected previously. False negatives are recorded when the patient fails to respond to stimulus significantly more intense than one they had previously seen. Taken together, fixation losses, false positives, and false negatives provide an indication of the quality of the test.</para>
        <para>The next phase of visual field interpretation is to assess for the presence of disease. The first aspect of the visual field data used here are the raw sensitivity values. These are usually expressed as a function of the amount of attenuation that could be applied to the maximum possible stimulus such that the patient could still see it when displayed. Since a value is available at each point tested in the visual field, these values can be represented either as raw values or as a graphical map.</para>

          </figure>
        </para>
        <para>Because the raw intensity values can be affected by a number of factors including age and other non-optic nerve problems including refractive error or any opacity along the visual axis (cornea, lens, vitreous), it is helpful to also evaluate some corrected values. One set of corrected intensity values is usually some indication of the difference of each tested point from its expected value based on patient age. Another set of corrected intensity values, referred to as "Pattern deviation or "Corrected comparison" are normalized for age and also have a value subtracted from the deviation at each test point, which is estimated to be due to diffuse visual field loss This latter set is useful for focal rather than diffuse defects in visual function. In the case of glaucoma and most other optic nerve disease, clinicians are more interested in focal defects so this second set of normalized data is useful.</para>

        <para>For all normalized visual field sensitivity data, it is useful to know how a particular value compares to a group of normal patients. Vendors of automated visual field machines therefore go to great lengths to collect data on such "normal" subjects to allow subsequent analysis. Furthermore, the various sets of values mentioned above can be summarized further using calculations like a mean and standard deviation. These values give some idea about the average amount of field loss (mean) and the focality of that loss (standard deviation).</para>
        <para>A final step in the clinical assessment of a visual field test is to review any disease-specific tests that are performed on the data. One such test is the Glaucoma Hemifield Test, which has been designed to identify field loss consistent with glaucoma. These tests are frequently vendor-specific.</para>

          <para>The Diffuse Defect is an estimate of the portion of a patient's visual field loss that is diffuse, or spread evenly across all portions of the visual field, in dB. In this graphical display, deviation from the average normal value for each test point is ranked on the x axis from 1 to 59, with 59 being the test point that has the greatest deviation from normal. Deviations from normal at each test point are represented on the y axis, in dB. The patient's actual test point deviations are represented by the thin blue line. Age corrected normal values are represented by the light blue band. The patient's deviation from normal at the test point ranked 25% among his or her own deviations is then estimated to be his or her diffuse visual field loss, represented by the dark blue band. This provides a graphical estimate of the remaining visual field loss for this patient, which is then presumed to consist of local visual field defects, which are more significant in management of
          glaucoma than diffuse defects.</para>

          <title>Local Defect</title>
          <para>The Local Defect is an estimate of the portion of a patient's visual field loss that is local, or not spread evenly across all portions of the visual field. The x and y axis in this graphical display have the same meaning as in the diffuse defect. In this graphical display the top line/blue band represent age corrected normal values. This line is shifted downward by the amount estimated to be due to diffuse visual field loss for this patient, according to the calculation in <xref linkend="figure_DDD.2-7" xrefstyle="select: label"/> (Diffuse Defect). The difference between the patient's test value at each point in the ranking on the horizontal axis and the point on the lower curve at the 50% point is represented by the dark blue section of the graph. This accentuates the degree of local visual field defect, which is more significant in management of glaucoma than diffuse defects. The Local Defect is an index that highly correlates with square root of the loss variance (sLV) but is less susceptible to false
          positives. In addition to the usage in white/white perimetry it is especially helpful as early identifier for abnormal results in perimetry methods with higher inter subject variability such as blue/yellow (SWAP) or flicker perimetry. An example of Local Defect is shown in <xref linkend="figure_DDD.2-8" xrefstyle="select: label"/> and is expressed in dark blue in dB and is normalized to be comparable between different test patterns.</para>

        <title>Z Offset Correction</title>
        <para>When an OCT image is acquired, the path length difference between the reference and sample arms may vary, resulting in a shift along the axial direction of the image, known as the Z Offset. With FOR PROCESSING images, in order to convert the image in Cartesian coordinates and make measurements, this Z Offset should be corrected, typically on a per-frame or per-image basis. Z Offset is corrected by shifting Polar data rows (A-lines) + OCT Z Offset Correction (0052,0030) pixels along the axial dimension of the image.</para>
        <para>Z Offset correction may be either a positive or negative value. Positive values mean that the A-lines are shifted further away from the catheter optics. Negative values mean that the A-lines are shifted closer to the catheter optics. <xref linkend="figure_EEE.2-1" xrefstyle="select: label"/> illustrates a negative Z Offset Correction.</para>

        <title>Refractive Index Correction</title>
        <para>The axial distances in an OCT image are dependent on the refractive index of the material that IVOCT light passes through. As a result, in order to accurately make measurements in images derived from FOR PROCESSING data, the axial dimension of the pixels should be globally corrected by dividing the A-line Pixel Spacing (0052,0014) value (in air) by the Effective Refractive Index (0052,0004) and setting the Refractive Index Applied (0052,003A) to YES. Although not recommended, if A-line Pixel Spacing (0052,0014) is reported in air (i.e., not corrected by dividing by Effective Refractive Index) then the Refractive Index Applied value shall be set to NO.</para>

        <title>Polar-Cartesian Conversion</title>
        <para>FOR PROCESSING Polar data is specified such that each column represents a subsequent axial (z) location and each row an angular (q) coordinate. Following Z Offset and Refractive Index Correction, Polar data can be converted to Cartesian data by first orienting the seam line position so that it is at the correct row location. This can be accomplished by shifting the rows Seam Line Index (0052,0036) pixels so that its Seam Line Location (0052,0033) is located at row "A-lines Per Frame * Seam Line Location / 360". Once the seam line is positioned correctly, the Cartesian data can be obtained by remapping the Polar (z, q) data into Cartesian (x, y) space, where the leftmost column of the Polar image corresponds to the center of the Cartesian image. <xref linkend="figure_EEE.2-2" xrefstyle="select: label"/> illustrates the Polar to Cartesian conversion. The scan-converted frames are constructed using the Catheter Direction of Rotation (0052,0031) attribute to determine the order in which the A-lines are acquired.
        Scan-converted frames are constructed using A-lines that contain actual data (I.e., not padded A-lines). Padded A-lines are added at the end of the frame and are contiguous. <xref linkend="figure_EEE.2-2" xrefstyle="select: label"/> is an example of Polar to Cartesian conversion.</para>

      <para>The Longitudinal reconstruction is comprised of a series of perpendicular cut planes, typically consisting of up to 360 slices spaced in degree increments. The cut planes are perpendicular to the cross-sectional plane, and rotate around the catheter axis (I.e., center of the catheter) to provide a full 360 degrees of rotation. A longitudinal slice indicator is used to select the cut plane to display, and is normally displayed in the associated cross-sectional image (e.g., blue arrow cursor in <xref linkend="figure_EEE.3-1" xrefstyle="select: label"/>). A current frame marker (e.g., yellow cursor located in the longitudinal view) is used to indicate the position of the corresponding cross-sectional image, within the longitudinal slice.</para>
      <para>When pullback rate information is provided, distance measurements are possible along the catheter axis. The Intravascular Longitudinal Distance (0052,0028) or IVUS Pullback Rate (0018,3101) attributes are used along with the Frame Acquisition DateTime (0018,9074) attribute to facilitate measurement calculations. This allows for lesion, calcium, stent and stent gap length measurements. <xref linkend="figure_EEE.3-2" xrefstyle="select: label"/> is an example of an IVOCT cross-sectional image (on the top), with a horizontal longitudinal view on the bottom. The following example also illustrates how the tint specified by the Palette Color LUT is applied to the OCT image.</para>

        <para>This chapter describes the concepts of the display pipeline.</para>

        <para>The X-Ray intensity that comes into contact with the image receptor is converted to the stored pixel data by applying specific signal processing. As a first step in this conversion, the amplitude of the digital signal out of the receptor is linearly proportional to the X-Ray intensity. In further steps, this digital signal is processed in order to optimize the rendering of the objects of interest present on the image.</para>
        <para>The Enhanced XA IOD includes attributes that describe the characteristics of the stored pixel data, allowing to relate the stored pixel data to the original X-Ray intensity independently from the fact that the image is "original" or "derived".</para>

For this purpose, the Pixel Intensity Relationship LUT described in <olink targetdoc="PS3.3" targetptr="sect_C.7.6.16.2.13.1" xrefstyle="select: docname label quotedtitle"/> defines a transformation LUT enabling the conversion from the stored pixel data values to linear, logarithmic or other relationship.</para>

The creation of subtracted data to be displayed is a manufacturer-dependent function.</para>
        <para>As an example of subtractive display, the pixel values are first transformed to a LOG relationship, and then subtracted to bring the background level to zero and finally expanded to displayable levels by using a non-linear function EXP similar to an exponential.</para>

          <para>If both modalities share a common data store, a dedicated post-processing station can be used for combined display of waveform and image information, and/or combined functional analysis of signals and pixel data to time relate the cardiac cycle phases to the angiographic frames. The storage of the waveform data and images to PACS or media will preserve the combined functional capabilities.</para>
          <para>In these application cases, this post-processing activity is outside the scope of the acquisition modalities. For more details about the relationship between cardiac cycle and angiographic frames, refer to the previous application case "ECG Recording at Acquisition Modality" (see <xref linkend="sect_FFF.2.1.1" xrefstyle="select: label"/>).</para>

              <para>In the XA SOP Class, the encoding of the angles is always with respect to the patient, so-called anatomical angles, and the image is assumed to be patient-oriented (i.e., heads-up display). In case of positioner rotation around an axis oblique to the patient, not aligned with the head-feet axis, it is not possible to encode the rotation of the image necessary for 3D reconstruction.</para>

              <para>The image acquisition is performed during a movement of the X-Ray Table in the tabletop plane, at constant speed and of one meter of distance, acquiring frames from the abdomen to the feet of the patient in one stepping movement for non-subtracted angiography.</para>

              <para>The field of view area is a region equal to or smaller than the active area, and is defined as the region that is effectively irradiated by the X-Ray beam when there is no collimation. The stored image is the image resulting from digitizing the field of view area.</para>
              <para>There is no attribute that relates the FOV origin to the intensifier. It is commonly assumed that the FOV area is centered in the intensifier.</para>
              <para>The position of the projection of the isocenter on the active area is undefined. It is commonly understood that the X-Ray positioner is calibrated so that the isocenter is projected in the approximate center of the active area, and the field of view area is centered in the active area.</para>

After one second the user starts the injection of 45 milliliters of contrast media Iodipamide (350 mg/ml Cholographin (Bracco) ) at a flow rate of 15 ml/sec during three seconds, in intra-arterial route. When the injection of contrast agent is finished, the user continues the X-Ray acquisition for two seconds until wash out of the contrast agent.</para>

            <para>The user performs an X-Ray acquisition with movement of the positioner during the acquisition. The patient is in Head First Supine position. During the review of the multi-frame image, a measurement of the object of interest in the frame "i" needs to be performed, which requires the calculation of the pixel spacing at the object location for that frame.</para>
            <para>For the frame "i", the Positioner Primary Angle is -30.0 degrees, and the Positioner Secondary Angle is 20.0 degrees. According to the definition of the positioner angles and given the patient position, the Beam Angle is calculated as follows:</para>
            <para><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italic">Beam Angle</emphasis></emphasis> = arcos( |cos(-30.0) | * |cos(20.0) | ) = 35.53 degrees</para>
            <para>The value of the other attributes defining the geometry of the acquisition for the frame "i" are the following:</para>
            <para><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italic">ISO</emphasis></emphasis> = 750 mm 
            <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italic">SID</emphasis></emphasis> = 983 mm

            <para>The user provides, via the application interface, an estimated value of the distance from the object of interest to the tabletop: 
            <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italic">TO</emphasis></emphasis> = 180 mm. This value can be encoded in the attribute Distance Object to Table Top (0018,9403) of the Projection Pixel Calibration Sequence (0018,9401) for further usage.</para>
            <para>This results in an 
            <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italic">SOD</emphasis></emphasis> of 741.4 mm (according to the equation SOD = 750mm - [(187mm-180mm) / cos(35.53°) ] ), and in a magnification ratio of SID/SOD of 1.32587.</para>
            <para>The resulting pixel spacing at the object location and related to the center of the X-Ray beam is calculated as 
            <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italic">ΔPx * SOD / SID</emphasis></emphasis> = 0.150844 mm/pix. This value can be encoded in the attribute Object Pixel Spacing in Center of Beam (0018,9404) of the Projection Pixel Calibration Sequence (0018,9401) for further usage.</para>

    <title>Unified Worklist and Procedure Step - UPS (Informative)</title>
    <section label="GGG.1" status="2" xml:id="sect_GGG.1">
      <title>Introduction</title>
      <para>This section provides examples of different implementations and message sequencing when using the Unified Worklist and Procedure Step SOP Classes (UPS Push, UPS Pull, UPS Watch and UPS Event).</para>
      <para>The examples are intended to provide a sense of how the UPS SOP Classes can be used to support a variety of workflow use cases. For the detailed specification of how the underlying DIMSE Services function, please refer to <olink targetdoc="PS3.4" targetptr="chapter_CC" xrefstyle="template: Annex %n “%t”"/>.</para>
      <para>The Unified Worklist and Procedure Step Service Class combines the information that is conveyed separately by the Modality Worklist and Modality Performed Procedure Step into a single normalized object. This object is created to represent the planned step and then updated to reflect its progress from scheduled to complete and record details of the procedure performed and the results created. Additionally, the Unified Worklist supports subscription based notifications of progress and completion.</para>
      <para>The Unified Worklist and Modality Procedure Step Service Class does not include support for complex internal task structures. It describes a single task to be performed in terms of the task request and the task results. Additional complexity is managed by the business logic.</para>
      <para>The UPS SOP Classes define services so UPSs can be created, their status managed, notifications sent and their attributes set, queried, and retrieved. DICOM intentionally leaves open the many combinations in which these services can be implemented and applied to enact a variety of approaches to workflow.</para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="bold">Pull Workflow and Push Workflow</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>Similar to previous SOP Classes like Modality Worklist, UPS allows a performing system (using the UPS Pull SOP Class as a C-FIND SCU) to query a worklist manager (the SCP) for relevant tasks and choose which one to start working on. This is sometimes called "Pull Workflow" since the performer pulls down the list and selects an item.</para>
      <para>UPS adds the ability for a scheduling system (using the UPS Push SOP Class as an N-CREATE SCU) to "push" a workitem onto the performing system (here an SCP). In "Push Workflow" the scheduler makes the choice of which system becomes responsible for the workitem.</para>
      <para>Performing systems (again as an SCP) could also schedule/create their own workitems, while allowing other systems (using the UPS Watch and UPS Event SOP Classes as N-EVENT-REPORT SCUs and N-GET SCUs) to receive notifications of the activities of the performer and examine the results.</para>
      <para>Push and Pull can also be combined in various ways. A high level departmental scheduler could break down orders and push tasks onto the acquisition worklist manager and reporting worklist manager from which modalities and reporting workstations could pull their tasks. In another scenario, a modality that has pulled an acquisition workitem off a worklist, could push a follow-up task onto a workstation to perform 3D processing or CAD on the results.</para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="bold">Reliable Watchers and Deletion Locks</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>Some UPS features (specifically the Deletion Lock - See <olink targetdoc="PS3.4" targetptr="sect_CC.2.3.2" xrefstyle="docname label"/>) were introduced to support Reliable Watchers. By subscribing with a Deletion Lock, an SCU wishing to be a reliable watcher can signal the SCP to persist instances until the watcher has been able to retrieve final state information and remove the lock.</para>
      <para>This means that network latency, slight delays in processing threads, or even the watcher being offline for a short time, will not prevent the watcher from reliably collecting the final state details from UPS instances it is interested in. This can be very important since the watcher may be responsible for monitoring completion of those instances, extracting details from them, and based on that and other internal logic, creating subsequent UPS Instances and populating the input data fields with information from the completed UPS. Without some form of persistence guarantee, UPS instances could disappear immediately upon entering a completed state.</para>
      <para>Having established the Deletion Lock mechanism, it is possible that, due to equipment or processing errors, there could be cases where locks are not properly removed and some UPS instances might remain when they are no longer needed. Most SCP implementations will likely provide a way for such orphaned UPS instances to be removed under administrator control.</para>

      <title>Implementation Examples</title>
      <para>The following sections describe ways UPS workflows could be used to address some typical scenarios.</para>
      <section label="GGG.2.1" status="3" xml:id="sect_GGG.2.1">
        <title>Typical SOP Class Implementations</title>
        <para>The decision of which SOP Classes to implement in which systems will revolve partly around where it makes the most sense for the business logic to reside, what information each system would have access to, and what kind of workflow is most effective for the users.</para>
        <para><xref linkend="table_GGG.1-1" xrefstyle="select: label"/> shows a number of hypothetical systems and the combination of SOP Classes they might implement. For example, a typical worklist manager would support all four SOP Classes as an SCP. A typical scheduling system might want to be a UPS Push SCU to submit work items to the worklist manager, a UPS Watch SCU to subscribe for notifications and get details of the results, and a UPS Event SCU to receive the progress notifications. A simple "pull performer" might only be a UPS Pull SCU, similar to modalities today.</para>

        <title>Other Examples</title>
        <para>A wide variety of workflow methods are possible using the UPS SOP Classes. In addition to those diagrammed in the previous sections, a few more are briefly described here. These include examples of ways to handle unscheduled tasks, grouped tasks, append cases, "event forwarding", etc.</para>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Self-Scheduling Push &amp; Pull: Unscheduled and Append Cases</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>In radiation therapy a previously unscheduled ("emergency") procedure may be performed on a Treatment Delivery System. Normally a TDS performs scheduled procedures as a Performing SCU in a Typical Pull Workflow like that shown in GGG.2.2. A TDS that might need to perform unscheduled procedures could additionally implement UPS Push (as an SCU) and push the "unscheduled" procedure to the departmental worklist server then immediately set it IN PROGRESS as a UPS Pull SCU. The initial Push to the departmental server allows the rest of the departmental workflow to "sync up" normally to the new task on the schedule.</para>
        <para>A modality choosing to append some additional images after the original UPS was completed could use a similar method. Since the original UPS can no longer be modified, the modality could push a new UPS instance to the Worklist Manager and then immediately set it IN PROGRESS. Many of the attribute values in the new UPS would be the same as the original UPS.</para>
        <para>Note that for a Pull Performer that wants to handle unscheduled cases, this Push &amp; Pull approach is pretty simple to implement. Becoming a UPS Push SCU just requires N-CREATE and N-ACTION (Request Cancel) that are quite similar to the N-SET and N-ACTION it already supports as a UPS Pull SCU.</para>
        <para>The alternative would be implementing both UPS Watch and UPS Event as an SCP, which would be more work. Further, potential listeners would have to be aware of and monitor the performing system to track the unscheduled steps, instead of just monitoring the departmental Pull SCP.</para>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Self-Scheduling Performer</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>An example of an alternative method for handling unscheduled procedures is a CAD workstation that decides for itself to perform processing on a study. By implementing UPS Watch as an SCP and UPS Event as an SCP, the workstation can create UPS instances internally and departmental systems such as the RIS can subscribe globally to the workstation to monitor its activities.</para>
        <para>The workstation might create the UPS tasks in response to having data pushed to it, or potentially the workstation could itself also be a Watch and Event SCU and subscribe globally to relevant modality or PACS systems and watch for appropriate studies.</para>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Push Daisy Chain</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>Sometimes the performer of the current task is in the best position to decide what the next task should be.</para>
        <para>An alternative to centralized task management is daisy-chaining where each system pushes the next task to the next performer upon completion of the current task. Using a workflow similar to the X-Ray Clinic example in GGG.6, a modality could push a task to a CAD workstation to process the images created by the modality. The task would specify the necessary images and perhaps parameters relevant to the acquisition technique. The RIS could subscribe globally with the CAD workstation to track events. Another example of push daisy chain would be for the task completed at each step in a reporting process to be followed by scheduling the next logical task.</para>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="bold">Hand-offs, Fail-overs and Putting Tasks Back on the Worklist</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>Sometimes the performer of the current task, after setting it to IN PROGRESS, may determine it cannot complete the task and would like the task performed by another system. It is not permitted to move the task backwards to the SCHEDULED state.</para>
        <para>One approach is for the performer to cancel the old UPS and schedule a new UPS to be pulled off the worklist by another system or by itself at some point in the future. The new UPS would be populated with details from the original. The details of the new UPS, such as the Input Information Sequence (0040,4021), the Scheduled Workitem Code Sequence (0040,4018), and the Scheduled Processing Parameters Sequence (0074,1210), might be revised to reflect any work already completed in the old UPS. By including the "Discontinued Procedure Step rescheduled" code in the Procedure Step Discontinuation Reason Code Sequence (0074,100e) of the old UPS, the performer can allow watchers and other systems monitoring the task to know that there is a replacement for the old canceled UPS. By referencing the UID of the old UPS in the Replaced Procedure Step Sequence (0074,1224) of the new UPS, the performer can allow watchers and other systems to find the new UPS that replaced the old. A
        proactive SCP might even subscribe watchers of the old UPS to the new UPS that replaces it.</para>
        <para>Alternatively, if the performer does not have the capability to create a new UPS, it could include the "Discontinued Procedure Step rescheduling recommended" code in the Procedure Step Discontinuation Reason Code Sequence (0074,100e). A very smart scheduling system could observe the cancellation reason and create the new replacement UPS as described above on behalf of the performer.</para>
        <para>Another approach is for the performer to "sub-contract" to another system by pushing a new UPS onto that system and marking the original UPS complete after the sub-contractor finishes.</para>
        <para>Yet another approach would be for the performer to deliver the Locking UID (by some unspecified mechanism) to another system allowing the new system to continue the work on the existing UPS. Coordination and reconciliation would be very important since the new system would need to review the current contents of the UPS, understand the current state, update the performing system information, etc.</para>

        <title>Gift Subscriptions</title>
        <para>The UPS Subscription allows the Receiving AE Title to be different than the AE Title of the SCU of the N-ACTION request. This allows an SCU to sign up someone else who would be interested for a subscription. For example, a reporting workflow manager could subscribe the RIS to UPSs the reporting workflow manager creates for radiology studies, and subscribe the CIS to UPSs it creates for cardiology studies. Or a RIS could subscribe the MPPS broker or the order tracking system to the high level UPS instances and save them from having independent business logic to determine which ones are significant.</para>
        <para>This can provide an alternative to systems using global subscriptions to stay on top of things. It also has the benefit of providing a way to avoid having to "forward" events. All interested SCUs get their events directly from the SCP. Instead of SCU A forwarding relevant events to SCU B, SCU A can simply subscribe SCU B to the relevant events.</para>

          <para>A General Practitioner (GP) in a clinic would like to check for imaging studies for the current patient. These studies are stored in a PACS, Vendor Neutral Archive (VNA) or HIE that supports QIDO functionality. The GP launches an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) application, and keys in the patient demographics to search for the patient record within the EMR. Once the record is open, the EMR, using QIDO, makes requests to the back-end systems, supplying Patient ID (including issuer) and possibly other parameters (date of birth, date range, modality, etc.). That system returns the available studies along with meta-data for each study that will help the GP select the study to open. The meta-data would include, but is not limited to, Study Description, Study Date, Modality, and Referring Physician.</para>

Once the user has selected a study and series, the software contacts the QIDO server again, requesting the SOP Instance UIDs of all images of a certain thickness (specified in specific DICOM tags) and frame of reference to be returned.

      <title>IHE ITI Compatibility</title>
      <para>There is a strong desire that the ITI Transaction RAD-69 be a proper implementation of the DICOM WS-* transaction. Note that RAD-69 is not the entire suite of XD* transactions. It is the "Retrieve Imaging Document Set" transaction.</para>
      <para>The RAD-69 transaction is quite simple, can be difficult to find all the parts of the ITI documentation. In summary, the RAD-69 transaction is a WS request to the IHE "RequestDocumentSet" action and related endpoints. The request is a list of "DocumentRequest", each "DocumentRequest" has three elements: required OID, required RepositoryID, and optional CommunityID. The response is a list of "DocumentResponse". Each "DocumentResponse" has four elements: required OID, required RepositoryID, required Document, and optional CommunityID.</para>
      <para>The mapping to DICOM for OID would be SOP Instance UID, and Document the DICOM contents. RepositoryID is analogous to the AE Title. It is not a perfect mapping. IHE considers the configuration where one system acts as a front end for multiple other systems, each identified by a RepositoryID. The CommunityID is an extension of this to "communities" that exchange data through gateways. The gateways will use the RepositoryID to identify internal repository systems.</para>
      <para>RAD-69 requires no understanding of document contents. They are binary blobs that are identified by an OID.</para>

    <section label="III.1" status="2" xml:id="sect_III.1">
      <title>Introduction</title>
      <para>Several ophthalmic devices produce thickness and/or height measurements of certain anatomical features of the posterior eye (e.g., optic nerve head topography, retinal thickness map, etc.). The measurements are mapped topographically as monochromatic images with pseudo color maps, and used extensively for diagnostic purposes by clinicians.</para>

      <title>Macular Retinal Thickness Example</title>
      <para>Quantitative ophthalmic OCT image analysis provides essential thickness measurement data of the retina. In the clinical practice two thickness parameters are commonly used: total retinal thickness (TR) in macular region and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFL) in optic nerve head (ONH) region. TR is widely applied to assess various retinal pathologies involving macula (e.g., cystoid macular edema, age-related macular degeneration, macular hole, etc.). The RNFL thickness measurement is most commonly used for glaucoma assessment.</para>
      <para>Figure III.2-1 is an example of 2D TR map computed on a 3D OCT cube data from a healthy eye. The color bar on the left provides a color-to-thickness representation to allow interpretation of the false color coded 2D thickness map in the middle. The image on the right shows one OCT frame representing a retinal cross section along the red line (across the middle of the thickness map). TR is defined as the thickness between internal limiting membrane (white line on the OCT frame on the right) and RPE/Choroid interface (blue line on the OCT frame). These two borders are automatically detected using a segmentation algorithm applied to the entire 3D volume.</para>

      <title>RNFL Example</title>
      <para>Figure III.3-1 is an example of a 2D RNFL map computed on a 3D OCT cube data from a healthy eye. The figure layout is the same as the previous example. The RNFL thickness is limited to the thickness of this single layer of the retina that is comprised of the ganglion cell axons that course to the optic nerve head and exit the eye as the optic nerve. Note that this image depicts a BMP mask in the center of the map where the optic nerve head (ONH) exists and no RNFL measurements can be obtained. In this example, the mask is displayed as a black area, which does not contain any thickness information (not zero micron thickness). Since the color bar representation is not relevant at the ONH, common practice is to mask it to avoid confusion or misinterpretation due to meaningless thickness data in this area.</para>

      <title>Diabetic Macular Edema Example</title>
      <para>A 48 year old Navajo male with diabetes, decreased visual acuity and fundoscopic stigmata of diabetic retinopathy receives several tests to assess his likelihood of macular edema. Optical coherence tomography (OPT) is performed to assess the thickness of the retina in the macular area. This is performed with retinal thickness depicted by ophthalmic mapping. The results is an Ophthalmic Thickness Map SOP instance with the Ophthalmic Thickness Mapping Type Code Sequence (0022,1436) set to "Absolute Ophthalmic Thickness" and the Measurements Units Code Sequence (0040,08EA) in the Real World Value Mapping Macro, set to "micrometer".

      <para>Since the thickness of the macula varies normally based upon a number of dependencies such as age, gender, race, etc. Interpretation of the retinal thickness in any given patient may be done in the context of normative data that accounts for these variables. The thickness data used to generate the thickness map is analyzed using a manufacturer specific algorithm for comparison to normative data relevant to this specific patient. The results of this analysis is depicted on a second thickness "map" (second SOP Instance) showing each pixel's variation from normal in terms of confidence that the variation is real and not due to chance. Specific confidence levels are then depicted by arbitrary color mapping registered to the fundus photograph. This is typically noted as the percent probability that the variation is abnormal e.g., p &gt;5%, p &lt;5%, p &lt;1% etc. The results is an Ophthalmic Thickness Map SOP instance with the Ophthalmic Thickness Mapping Type Code Sequence
      (0022,1436) set to "Thickness deviation category from normative data". Mapping the "categories" to a code concept is accomplished via Attribute Pixel Value Mapping to Coded Concept Sequence (0022,1450).</para>

Corneal pachymetry showed slight thinning in both eyes at 523µ OD (right eye) and 530µ OS (left eye). Static threshold perimetry testing showed nonspecific defects OU (both eyes) and was unreliable due to multiple fixation losses. Confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy produced OPM topographic representations of both optic nerves suggestive of glaucoma. The contouring of the optic nerve head (ONH) in the left eye showed a slightly enlarged cup with diffuse thinning of the superior neural rim. In the right eye, there was greater enlargement of the cup and sloping of the cup superior-temporally with a clear notch of the neural rim at the 12:30 position. Corneal compensated scanning laser polarimetry was performed bilaterally. Analysis of the OPM representation of the retinal nerve fiber layer
      (RNFL) thickness map showed moderate retinal nerve fiber loss with accentuation at the superior pole bilaterally. The patient was diagnosed with normal tension glaucoma and started on a glaucoma medication. Follow-up examinations showed stable reduction in his IOP to 11 mm Hg OU (both eyes) and no further progression of his ONH or RNFL defects.</para>

      <title>Retinal Thickness Definition</title>
      <para>Using OCT technology, there are typically 2 major highly reflective bands generally visible; inner and outer highly reflective bands (IHRB and OHRB).</para>
      <para>The inner band corresponds to the inner portion of the retina, which consists of ILM (internal limiting membrane), RNFL (retinal nerve fiber layer), GCL (ganglion cell layer), IPL (inner plexiform layer), INL (inner nuclear layer), and OPL (outer plexiform layer). In terms of the reflectivity, they present a high-low-high-low-high pattern, in general. Presumably RNFL, IPL, and OPL are the highly reflective layers and GCL and INL are of low reflectivity. ILM itself may or may not be visible in OCT images (depending on the scanning beam incidence angle), but for convenience it is used to label the vitreo-retinal interface.</para>

      <para>When interpreting quantitative data obtained from imaging devices, comparing may be an issue.

      <para>Currently there are multiple SD-OCT devices independently manufactured, and data comparability has become problematic. When patients change doctors or otherwise receive care from more than one provider, previously acquired data may occur on different devices and become almost useless simply because the present doctor has no access to the same device.

In this case new baseline measurements must be obtained due to incomparability of the data (this happens even for the same make different generation devices).

    <title>Use-cases For Conversion of Classic Single Frame Images to Legacy Converted Enhanced Multi-frame Images (Informative)</title>
    <section label="KKK.1" status="2" xml:id="sect_KKK.1">
      <title>Introduction</title>
      <para>Traditionally, images from cross-sectional modalities like CT, MR and PET have been stored with one reconstructed slice in a single frame instance. Large studies with a large number of slices potentially pose a problem for many existing implementations, both for efficient transfer from the central store to the user's desktop for viewing or analysis, and for bulk transfer between two stores (e.g., between a PACS and another archive or a regional image repository).</para>
      <para>There are two primary issues:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Transporting large numbers of slices as separate single instances (files) is potentially extremely inefficient due to the overhead associated with each transfer (such as C-STORE acknowledgment and database insertion).</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Replicating the Attributes describing the entire patient/study/series/acquisition in every separate single instance is also potentially extremely inefficient, and though the size of the this information is trivial by comparison with the bulk data, the effort to repeatedly parse it and sort out what it means as a whole on the receiving end is not trivial.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>The Enhanced family of modality-specific multi-frame IODs is intended to address both these concerns, but there is a large installed base of older equipment that does not yet support these, both on the sending and receiving end, and a large archive of single frame instances.</para>
      <para>An interim step, a legacy transition strategy for a mixed environment containing older and newer modalities, PACS and workstations, is described here. It is predicated on the ability to "convert" single frame instances into new "enhanced multi-frame instances".</para>

      <title>Enhanced Legacy Converted Image Storage IODs</title>
      <para>The Enhanced family of modality-specific multi-frame IODs contain many requirements that cannot be satisfied by the limited information typically available in the older single frame objects. A family of Multi-frame Secondary Capture IODs is available, but their use would mean that a recipient could not depend on the presence of important cross-sectional information like spacing, position and orientation. Accordingly, a new family of modality-specific Legacy Converted Enhanced Image Storage IODs has been defined that bridge the gap in conversion complexity and usability between these two extremes.</para>

      <title>Compatibility With Modality Association Negotiation</title>
      <para>This strategy is compatible with an approach commonly implemented on acquisition modalities when deciding which SOP Class to use to encode images.</para>
      <para>Normally a modality will propose in the Association that images be transferred using the SOP Class for which the IOD provides the richest set of information (i.e., the True Enhanced Image Storage SOP Class), and will choose the corresponding Abstract Syntax for C-STORE Operations if the Association Acceptor accepts multiple choices of SOP Class.</para>
      <para>Consider a modality that supports the appropriate modality-specific Enhanced Image Storage SOP Class, but which is faced with the dilemma of a PACS that does not. In this case, it will commonly "fall back" to sending images the "old" way as single-frame SOP Class Instances, either because it has been pre-configured that way by service personnel, or because it discovers this limitation during Association Negotiation. This strategy is also common amongst modalities for which there are different choices of single frame SOP Class (e.g., DX versus CR versus Secondary Capture, for Digital X-Rays). In some cases, this may be implemented formally using the ability during Association Negotiation to specify a Related General SOP Class (<olink targetdoc="PS3.4" targetptr="sect_B.4.2.1" xrefstyle="select: docname label quotedtitle"/>).</para>
      <para>If the PACS is upgraded to include multi-frame conversion capability, and no change is made in the configuration of the modality, or in the SOP Classes accepted by the PACS, then in this scenario, the PACS can potentially convert the single-frame instances into Legacy Converted Enhanced instances. The net result is continuing sacrifice of information compared to what the modality is actually capable of.</para>
      <para>A better choice, since the PACS is now capable of handling multi-frame images, is to also reconfigure it to also accept the "true" Enhanced Image rather than just "transitional" Legacy Converted Enhanced Storage SOP Classes. Since the two SOP Class families use the same structure and common important Functional Groups, in all likelihood the PACS will be able to use either class of objects, and in a future upgrade take advantage of the additional information in the superior object (perhaps for more complex processing or annotation or rendering). In any case, storing the modality's best output in the archive will benefit future re-use as priors and may enable greater functionality in external workstations.</para>
      <para>A special consideration is when prior images need to be displayed on the modality before starting a new study (perhaps to setup a comparable protocol or better understand the request). In this case, care needs to be taken with respect to which images are accessible to the modality (either pushed to it or retrieved by it), and the question of "round trip fidelity" of conversion arises.</para>

      <title>Query and Retrieval</title>
      <para>The coexistence (either actually or logically) of two different representations of the same information creates a potential challenge in that the user must not be presented with both sets simultaneously.</para>
      <para>A <foreignphrase xml:lang="fr">naïve</foreignphrase> conversion that added converted images to the study without an ability to distinguish or "filter" them from view would not only be confusing but would potentially result in twice as much data to transfer.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>An "enhanced" view, which includes either original (as received) enhanced multi-frame images, or classic single frame images converted to true or legacy converted enhanced multi-frame.</para>

    <section label="KKK.6" status="2" xml:id="sect_KKK.6">
      <title>Referential Integrity</title>
      <para>Often instances within a Study will cross-reference each other. For example, a Presentation State or a Structured Report or an RT Structure Set will reference the images to which they apply, cross-sectional images may reference localizer images, and images that were acquired with annotations may contain references to Presentation States encoding those annotations.</para>
      <para>Accordingly, when there are multiple "views" of the same study content (classic or enhanced), the instances will have different SOP Instance and Series Instance UIDs for converted content in each view. Hence any references within an instance to a converted instance needs to be updated as well. In doing such an update of references to UIDs, instances that might not otherwise have needed to be converted do need to be converted, and so on, until the entire set of instances within the scope of the conversion for the view has referential integrity.</para>
      <para>In practice, the only instances that do not need to be converted (and assigned new UIDs) are those that contain no references and are not classic or enhanced images to be converted.</para>
      <para>Whether or not assignment of a converted instance to a new Series triggers the need to convert all instances in that Series to the new Series, even if they would not otherwise be converted, is not defined (i.e., it is neither required nor prohibited, and hence a Series can be "split" as a consequence of conversion).</para>
      <para>The scope of referential integrity required is defined to be the Patient. Instances in one Study may be referenced from another (e.g., as prior images).</para>
    </section>
    <section label="KKK.7" status="2" xml:id="sect_KKK.7">
      <title>Persistence and Determinism</title>
      <para>The rules for conversion specify that the SOP Instance and Series Instance UIDs of converted images be changed, and that the same UIDs be used each time that a query or retrieval is performed. The strict separation of the two "views" of the same information, coupled with the "determinism" that results in the same identification and organization of each view every time, are required for stability across successive operations.</para>
      <para>Were this not to be the case, for example, the results of a query (C-FIND) might be different from the results of a subsequent retrieval (C-MOVE or C-GET), or for that matter, successive queries. Further, references to specific instance UID in either view may be recorded in external systems (e.g., in an EMR), hence it is important that these remain stable and accessible.</para>
      <para>This places a burden on the Q/R SCP to either retain a record of the mapping of UIDs from one view to the other, or to use some deterministic process that results in the same UIDs (one could envisage some hashing scheme, for instance). How this is implemented is beyond the scope of the standard to define. The determinism requirement does not remove the uniqueness requirement; in particular it is not appropriate to attempt to derive new UIDs by adding a suffix to a UID generated by a different application, for example.</para>
      <para>There is no time limit placed on the determinism; it is expected to be indefinite, at least within the control of the system. This is a factor that should be taken into account both in the design of federated Q/R SCPs that may integrate subsidiary SCPs that support this mechanism. It should also be considered during migration to a new Q/R SCP, which ideally should support the mechanism, and should support the same mapping from one view to another as was provided by the Q/R SCP being migrated. This may be non-trivial, since the algorithm for conversion may be different between the two systems. It may be necessary to define some persistent, standard, serialized mapping of one set of UIDs to the other.</para>

Accordingly, converted instances are required to contain such references, both for image conversions as well as for ancillary instances that may be updated, such as Presentation States and Structured Reports.</para>
      <para>Obviously, the references to the source instances for the conversion are excluded from conversion themselves. If the instances have been converted on different systems, however, there is a possibility that the source references will be "replaced" and a record of the "chain" of multiple conversions will not be persisted.</para>
      <para>There is no mechanism to define forward references in the source to the converted instances, since that would imply changing the source instances from their original form, and while this is acceptable within the scope of the normal "coercion" that a Storage SCP is permitted to perform, it is probably not sufficiently useful to justify the effort. This does imply some asymmetry however, depending on the direction of conversion (classic to enhanced or vice versa); only one set will contain the references.</para>
      <para>In performing round trip conversion, without access to the source instances, the referenced source UIDs can be used as the UIDs for the newly created converted instances.</para>

      <title>Uncertainty Principle</title>
      <para>When does a converted view come into existence? By definition, when it is "observed". However, a practical question is when to start conversion. A Study is never, theoretically, complete, yet the semantics for conversion and consistency are defined at the Study level.</para>
      <para>Another practical question is whether or not to make the received instances available, even though the converted ones may not yet have been created.</para>
      <para>In the absence of the concept of "study completion" in DICOM, no firm rules can be defined. However, in practice, most systems have an internal "completion" concept, which may or may not be related to the completion of the Performed Procedure Steps that are related to the sets of instances in question, or may be established through some other mechanism, such as operator intervention, possibly via a RIS message (e.g., after QC checks are signed off as complete, or after a Study has been declared as "ready to read").</para>
      <para>A system may elect to "dynamically" begin conversion as instances arrive and update the information in the conversion as new instances are encountered, or it may wait until some state is established that allows it to perform the conversion "statically". In either case, the information in the converted view via the query/retrieval mechanisms should be immutable once made available. I.e., once a conversion has been "distributed", it would be desirable for the system to block subsequent changes to the Study, except to the extent that there is a need for correction and management of errors (in which case mechanisms such as IHE Image Object Change Management (IOCM) may be appropriate).</para>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <para>Several ophthalmic devices produce curvature and/or elevation measurements of corneal anterior and posterior surfaces (e.g., maps that display corneal curvatures, corneal elevations, and corneal power, etc.). The principle methods used include reflection of light from the corneal surface (e.g., Placido ring topography) and multiple optical sectioning or slit beam imaging (e.g., Scheimpflug tomography). The measurements are mapped topographically as pseudo-color maps, and used extensively for diagnostic purposes by clinicians and to fit contact lenses in difficult cases. The underlying data from these measurements is also used to guide laser sculpting in keratorefractive surgery.</para>

      <title>Corneal Topography Scales and Color Palettes</title>
      <para>The method for presenting corneal topography maps with pseudo-colored images has been studied extensively. Contour maps are effective for diagnostic purposes. The proper scaling is important so that clinically important detail is not obscured as well irrelevant detail masked. This can be done with a scale that has fixed dioptric intervals. The choice of color palette to represent different levels of corneal power is equally important. There must be enough contrast between adjacent contour colors to provide pattern recognition; it is the corneal topography pattern that is used for clinical interpretation. A color palette can be chosen so that lower corneal powers are represented with cooler colors (blue shades), while higher corneal powers are represented with the warmer colors (red shades). Green shades are used to represent corneal powers associated with normal corneas. The standard scale is shown in <xref linkend="figure_NNN.2-1" xrefstyle="select: label"/>.</para>

      <title>Corneal Topography Examples</title>
      <para>Quantitative measurements of anterior corneal surface curvature (corneal topography) are made with the Placido ring approach. Patterns on an illuminated target take the form of mires or a grid pattern. Their reflection from the anterior corneal surface tear film, shown in <xref linkend="figure_NNN.3-1" xrefstyle="select: label"/>, is captured with a video camera. Their positions relative to the instrument axis are determined through image analysis and these data are used to calculate anterior corneal curvature distribution.</para>

      <para>Corneal curvature calculations are accomplished with three different methods that provide corneal powers. The axial power map, shown in <xref linkend="figure_NNN.3-2" xrefstyle="select: label"/>, is most useful clinically for routine diagnostic use as the method of calculation presents corneal topography maps that match the transitions known for corneal shape-the cornea is relatively steep in its central area, flattening toward the periphery. This figure shows an example where the map is superimposed over the source image based upon the corneal vertex Frame of Reference. The Blending Presentation State SOP Class may be used to specify this superimposed processing.</para>

      <title>Wavefront Map Example</title>
      <para>Ocular wavefront produces a measurement of optical path difference (OPD) between ideal optical system and the one being measured. Typically the OPD is measured and displayed in units of microns. Wavefront maps can be produced from the corneal surfaces, most often the front surface, since this is the major refracting surface in the eye account for about 80% of the ocular power.</para>
      <para>Wavefront maps can be calculated directly from corneal elevation data most often using the Zernike polynomial fitting series. With this method, corneal optical characteristics such as astigmatism, spherical aberration, and coma can be calculated. Generally, the lower order (LO) aberrations (offsets, refractive error and prism) are eliminated from display, so that only the higher order (HO) aberrations remain, shown in <xref linkend="figure_NNN.5-1" xrefstyle="select: label"/>.</para>
