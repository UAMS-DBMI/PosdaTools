      <title>History</title>
      <para>With the introduction of computed tomography (CT) followed by other digital diagnostic
        imaging modalities in the 1970's, and the increasing use of computers in clinical
        applications, the American College of Radiology (ACR) and the National Electrical
        Manufacturers Association (NEMA) recognized the emerging need for a standard method for
        transferring images and associated information between devices manufactured by various
        vendors. These devices produce a variety of digital image formats.</para>
      <para>The American College of Radiology (ACR) and the National Electrical Manufacturers
        Association (NEMA) formed a joint committee in 1983 to develop a standard to:</para>
      <para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Promote communication of digital image information, regardless of device
              manufacturer</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>Facilitate the development and expansion of picture archiving and communication
              systems (PACS) that can also interface with other systems of hospital
              information</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>Allow the creation of diagnostic information data bases that can be interrogated
              by a wide variety of devices distributed geographically.</para>

        </itemizedlist>
      </para>
      <para>ACR-NEMA Standards Publication No. 300-1985, published in 1985 was designated version
        1.0. The Standard was followed by two revisions: No. 1, dated October 1986 and No. 2, dated
        January 1988.</para>
      <para>ACR-NEMA Standards Publication No. 300-1988, published in 1988 was designated version
        2.0. It included version 1.0, the published revisions, and additional revisions. It also
        included new material to provide command support for display devices, to introduce a new
        hierarchy scheme to identify an image, and to add data elements for increased specificity
        when describing an image.</para>
      <para>These Standards Publications specified a hardware interface, a minimum set of software
        commands, and a consistent set of data formats.</para>

      <title>The DICOM Standard</title>
      <para>This Standard, which is currently designated Digital Imaging and Communications in
        Medicine (DICOM), embodies a number of major enhancements to previous versions of the
        ACR-NEMA Standard:</para>
      <para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>It is applicable to a networked environment. The ACR-NEMA Standard was applicable
              in a point-to-point environment only; for operation in a networked environment a
              Network Interface Unit (NIU) was required. DICOM supports operation in a networked
              environment using the industry standard networking protocol TCP/IP.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>It is applicable to an off-line media environment. The ACR-NEMA Standard did not
              specify a file format or choice of physical media or logical filesystem. DICOM
              supports operation in an off-line media environment using industry standard media such
              as CD-R and MOD and logical filesystems such as ISO 9660 and PC File System
              (FAT16).</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>It specifies how devices claiming conformance to the Standard react to commands
              and data being exchanged. The ACR-NEMA Standard was confined to the transfer of data,
              but DICOM specifies, through the concept of Service Classes, the semantics of commands
              and associated data.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>It specifies levels of conformance. The ACR-NEMA Standard specified a minimum
              level of conformance. DICOM explicitly describes how an implementor must structure a
              Conformance Statement to select specific options.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>It is structured as a multi-part document. This facilitates evolution of the
              Standard in a rapidly evolving environment by simplifying the addition of new
              features. ISO directives that define how to structure multi-part documents have been
              followed in the construction of the DICOM Standard.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para> It introduces explicit Information Objects not only for images and graphics but
              also for waveforms, reports, printing, etc.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>It specifies an established technique for uniquely identifying any Information
              Object. This facilitates unambiguous definitions of relationships between Information
              Objects as they are acted upon across the network.</para>
          </listitem>

      </para>
    </section>
    <section label="" status="2" xml:id="sect_CurrentDirection">
      <title>Current Direction</title>
      <para>The DICOM Standard is an evolving standard and it is maintained in accordance with the
        Procedures of the DICOM Standards Committee. Proposals for enhancements are forthcoming from
        the DICOM Committee member organizations based on input from users of the Standard. These
        proposals are considered for inclusion in future editions of the Standard. A requirement in
        updating the Standard is to maintain effective compatibility with previous editions.</para>
    </section>
    <section label="" status="2" xml:id="sect_Retirement">
      <title>Retirement</title>
      <para>Part of the maintenance process involves retirement of sections of the Standard,
        including but not limited to, IODs, Attributes, Service Classes, SOP Classes, Transfer
        Syntaxes and Protocols.</para>
      <para>Retirement does not imply that these features cannot be used. However, the DICOM
        Standards Committee will not maintain the documentation of retired features. The reader is
        referred to earlier editions of the Standard.</para>
      <para>The use of the retired features is deprecated in new implementations, in favor of those
        alternatives remaining in the standard.</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>For network communications, a set of protocols to be followed by devices claiming

        <listitem>
          <para>The implementation details of any features of the Standard on a device claiming
              conformance.

        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>The overall set of features and functions to be expected from a system implemented
            by integrating a group of devices each claiming DICOM conformance.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>A testing/validation procedure to assess an implementation's conformance to the
            Standard.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    <para>The DICOM Standard pertains to the field of Medical Informatics. Within that field, it
      addresses the exchange of digital information between medical imaging equipment and other
      systems. Because such equipment may interoperate with other medical devices, the scope of this
      Standard needs to overlap with other areas of medical informatics. However, the DICOM Standard
      does not address the breadth of this field.</para>

      <title>PS3.3: Information Object Definitions</title>
      <para><olink targetdoc="PS3.3" targetptr="PS3.3" xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/> of the DICOM Standard specifies a number of Information Object Classes that
        provide an abstract definition of real-world entities applicable to communication of digital
        medical images and related information (e.g., waveforms, structured reports, radiation
        therapy dose, etc.). Each Information Object Class definition consists of a description of
        its purpose and the Attributes that define it. An Information Object Class does not include
        the values for the Attributes that comprise its definition.</para>
      <para>Two types of Information Object Classes are defined: normalized and composite.</para>
      <para>Normalized Information Object Classes include only those Attributes inherent in the
        real-world entity represented. For example the study Information Object Class, which is
        defined as normalized, contains study date and study time Attributes because they are
        inherent in an actual study. Patient name, however, is not an Attribute of the study
        Information Object Class because it is inherent in the patient on which the study was
        performed and not the study itself.</para>
      <para>Composite Information Object Classes may additionally include Attributes that are
        related to but not inherent in the real-world entity. For example, the Computed Tomography
        Image Information Object Class, which is defined as composite, contains both Attributes that are inherent in the image (e.g., image date) and Attributes that are related to but
        not inherent in the image (e.g., patient name). Composite Information Object Classes provide
        a structured framework for expressing the communication requirements of images where image
        data and related data needs to be closely associated.</para>
      <para>To simplify the Information Object Class definitions, the Attributes of each Information
        Object Class are partitioned with similar Attributes being grouped together. These groupings
        of Attributes are specified as independent modules and may be reused by other Composite
        Information Object Classes.</para>
      <para><olink targetdoc="PS3.3" targetptr="PS3.3" xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/> defines a model of the Real World along with the corresponding Information Model
        that is reflected in the Information Object Definitions. Future editions of this Standard
        may extend this set of Information Objects to support new functionality.</para>
      <para>To represent an occurrence of a real-world entity, an Information Object Instance is
        created, which includes values for the Attributes of the Information Object Class. The
        Attribute values of this Information Object Instance may change over time to accurately
        reflect the changing state of the entity that it represents. This is accomplished by
        performing different basic operations upon the Information Object Instance to render a
        specific set of services defined as a Service Class. These Service Classes are defined in <olink targetdoc="PS3.4" targetptr="PS3.4" xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/> of the Standard.</para>

      <para><olink targetdoc="PS3.4" targetptr="PS3.4" xrefstyle="select: labelnumber"/> of the DICOM Standard defines a number of Service Classes. A Service Class
        associates one or more Information Objects with one or more Commands to be performed upon
        these objects. Service Class Specifications state requirements for Command Elements and how
        resulting Commands are applied to Information Objects. Service Class Specifications state

    <para>Since changes to the Standard shall not be cited prior to adoption as Final Text, and
      since after adoption they are formally part of the Standard, there should be no citations to
      supplements or correction items for the purpose of describing conformance. Reference to such
      change documents may be made for describing the historical development of the DICOM
      Standard.</para>
